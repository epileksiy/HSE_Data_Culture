Worm.is: The Game	81690624	USD	0.0	2.1.0	9+	Games	38	3	16	1	"Smash worms or slither trying!
Warning: Incredibly addicting Multiplayer Game!

LAG: If you experience high latency, please open the Settings Menu and change your server location 

You are a worm and you slither around looking for food to eat to get longer. Other worms, likewise, slither around you seeking for food and trying to cut in front of you. When your head hits another worm you become food for worms. Try to intercept your enemies as they slither to kill them and eat their mass. Finally, beware of the viruses!

Wormis allows you to:
- Three Game Modes: Free for all, Random Team, Hunger Games, Others coming soon
- Private rooms to play with friends
- Eat food to gain length
- Cut other worms' way to kill them and finally eat them
- Stay away from viruses: they slow you down and absorb your mass
- Expel mass to give it to other worms
- Have a lot of fun!

They are the most powerful beings in the Galaxy and their followers are legion.

The new combative team play will appeal to fans of Talisman and the Horus Heresy alike. It’s a unique adaptation of Talisman that has been tailored specifically for digital platforms.

In Talisman: The Horus Heresy the player’s experience of Talisman is scaled up exponentially, exploring not a kingdom but a whole galaxy in the 31st Millennium. No longer will you be fighting for the Crown of Command, but for the very future of humanity…

- Command one of the eighteen Space Marine Legions that fought during the Horus Heresy
- Play as one of eight of the galaxy’s greatest heroes or most notorious villains such as Roboute Guilliman or Angron

Princess Pet Palace: Royal Puppy - Pet Care, Play & Dress Up	132009984	USD	0.0	1.1	4+	Games	40	5	1	1	"Sadly, a homeless puppy was wandering on the street! Luckily, the kind princess found the poor thing and took it back to her palace, where the lovely stories between them got started!

Actually our sweet princess got a few doggies living in her palace. Her care and love warmly nourish the little ones' lives! And also because of their arrival, this royal place is filled up with cheers and laughter! Doggies are sports lovers, hurdles, ball, frisbee…which are fun but can also get them messy and tired after a long day. Maybe a bubble bath and a sweet sleep will drive the tiredness away! All right, let's go back to the palace and relax a little bit. Look~ the fire is burning in the fireplace, the little fur balls are horsing around and the princess is sitting there watching them. What could be more beautiful than this? 

How to play:
Open the game, you'll see 4 cuties wagging their tails to call you, and tap one to start its everyday care. Well, the little guy needs a shower to freshen itself up, a pretty costume to adorn its look and some food to become vigorous! All right, it's sports time now! Let's try the hurdles, slide or click the screen to help the puppy get over them! Great! You work well with each other! And the little one wants to play a hide and seek game with you. Ok, hide a delicious bone somewhere and wait for it to find out. Well, the fun never stops, here you can also see a puppy flying in a big bubble, but not in your dream. Good news! The magazine Libii Pets invites you to do a photo shoot and you can tap the ""show"" icon to kick it off. What? The doggie doesn't have a nice costume for that? Don’t worry, you can work harder with your pet to complete the achievements and win more unique items. Come on! Wow us with an amazing cover!

 Features:
- 4 unique little cuties to melt your heart
- Live and have fun with them

- New York Times, nytimes.com

rymdkapsel is a meditative strategy game set in space. Take on the challenge of building the best possible station by commanding your minions and exploring the galaxy around you.

Imagine a strategy game where you don't have to worry about selecting units or mounting attacks on your enemies, but rather can focus on building the best base possible. 

That's what rymdkapsel is all about.

""Rymdkapsel feels tailor-made for iOS in both form and function, and its elegant, subtle constituent parts nest within one another as neatly as its four-block tetrominos snap together along a space station corridor.""
- 5/5 stars, Joseph Leray, toucharcade.com

""Some games nearly make me miss my subway stop. Some games tempt me to keep on playing them while I'm walking down the street. This is one of them."" 
- Stephen Totilo, kotaku.com

""The game punishes the greedy, and rewards the prudent. If you’re attentive, you’ll notice that there’s actually a happy medium between the two: optimal efficiency.""
- Ryan Rigney, wired.co.uk

""Rymdkapsel combines spatial puzzling, tower defence and base-building into a brilliantly coherent and stylish whole.""

Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions has arrived for iPhone/iPod touch!

Released as the Final Fantasy series' first tactical RPG in 1997, Final Fantasy Tactics on Playstation went on to sell over 2.4 million copies worldwide. The game grew in popularity upon its re-release in 2007 as Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions for the PSP with added features such as new movies, scenarios and Jobs.

Now, in 2011 the game has finally arrived for the iPhone/iPod touch! You can enjoy the game whose story gave life to the world of Ivalice, and whose high strategy battles bring tactical games to a whole new level. 


■Game features

When the Wizard of Darkness awakened, it was up to one man to defeat him. When that man was accidentally killed by one idiot, Tobuscus (or ""person of extremely low intelligence"" - gently put), the responsibility of becoming an AWESOME WIZARD fell onto him... by default!

GAME FEATURES:

- Play as Tobuscus and unlock new spells, wands, and potions as you level up!

- Battle tons of zombies, liches, and other evil creatures on 20 different maps across the Frozen Forest and Molten Mountains!

- Upgrade your Tower and Wizard Gear... or else you'll probably die!

- Draw ancient symbols on your screen to cast spells... ancient like, uhm... a triangle! Or a swirly circle-y thingy to create a huge tornado, allowing you to tilt your touchscreen Spellbook to tell the wind where to spin, hurling zombies into the outer atmosphere and almost out of the screen into REALITY ITSELF!

- Exclusive animated scenes that will bring you into the game in a way no other game has ever done as awesomely anywhere ever before!

- Launch your faithful dog that trusts you - Gryphon - from a cannon directly into battle to plant bombs and explode herds of zombies!

- Gabuscus is also in the game. (He made me include this.)

Legend holds that he who lays his hands upon its trunk will be granted power eternal―a power the Dark Lord of Glaive now seeks to further fuel his bloody quest for domination.

Our unlikely hero is one of countless gladiators indentured to the Duchy of Glaive. Each day, he and his ill-fated companions are dragged from their cells and bade to fight exotic beasts for the amusement of the Dark Lord. If victorious, they are thrown back into the dungeons with just enough bread to tide them over until their next match. But a body can only take so much, and it is never long before the weary captives succumb to their cruel fates.

■SYSTEM
Adventures of Mana's battle system grants you the freedom to move about the playing field without restriction, allowing for thrilling combat in which you decide when to attack and how to evade.

・Controls
Player movement is achieved via a virtual joystick accessible anywhere on the screen. An auto-adjust feature has also been added so that even if your thumb strays from its original position, you will never lose control of the hero.

・Weapons
Weapons are divided into six unique categories, some with uses beyond merely dealing damage. Determining when and where to equip each kind will prove the key to success on your quest.

・Magic
From restoring lost HP or removing various ailments, to rendering foes incapacitated or dealing deadly blows, there are eight different spells for almost any occasion.

・Obstacles
Bloodthirsty enemies are not the only things standing in the way of completing your quest. You will need both tools and your wits to overcome the many challenges encountered in the world of Mana, ranging from locked doors to hidden rooms to traps growing progressively more complex as the game progresses."	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	18	2048	0	1

From the creators of TIME's Game of the Year 2014 and four-time BAFTA nominee, ""80 Days"", comes the final part of the epic, acclaimed Steve Jackson's Sorcery! series, co-creator of Games Workshop and Fighting Fantasy (with Iain Livingstone).

Using inkle's unique ink engine, the story is written in real-time, built around your choices and actions. Every action is remembered, and every decision, however small, can make the different between life and death, success and failure, humiliation or triumph. 

Sorcery! 4 is our most complex story to date, featuring over half a million words of adaptive content which incorporates all your choices from previous parts. 

The Sorcery! is true epic, interactive storytelling - and it concludes here."	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	10	3328	0	1

Tumblr	151573504	USD	0.0	8.6	17+	Social Networking	37	5	16	1	"Tumblr is a place to discover and post about stuff you love, and join communities of people who love that same stuff. It’s pretty neat. 

Q: What can I post on Tumblr? 
A: Photos, videos, live videos, songs, text—pretty much anything. 

Q: Can I make gifs? 
A: Yes, you CAN make gifs! You can make them out of videos, bursts, live photos, or just shoot them on the spot. 

Q: What’s the deal with “reblogging”? 
A: It’s a way to take the stuff you find on Tumblr and make it your own. You can repost other people’s posts to your own blog. You can add commentary if you like. Other people can do the same with your posts. That’s how ideas spread on Tumblr, and it’s how communities form around them. 

Q: Who’s on Tumblr? 
A: People who are posting and reblogging about interesting stuff that you’re interested in. Politics. Movies. Memes and such. If you’ve ever seen anything interesting on the internet, chances are it came from Tumblr. 

Q: How do I talk to people on Tumblr? 
A: A few different ways. You can comment on a post, or you can reblog a post to your own Tumblr and add commentary, or you can send a private message. Whatever suits the occasion. 

Q: How do I find stuff to follow? 
A: Search for whatever you’re interested in. We’ll show you great posts about that stuff, and get you following the people who make those posts. Oh, you can also follow a search itself, and we’ll put sift the best material from that search right into your dashboard. 

Q: What kind of stuff are people talking about on Tumblr *right now*? 
A: Whatever’s happening in the world. The real world, the world of fiction, the world of pop culture, the world of academics, the world of safety and justice, the world of sports. Whatever world you live in, you’ll find it among all the trending topics in the search tab. 

Q: Do all Tumblrs look the same? 
A: No! You can totally customize your Tumblr’s appearance, right down to the colors and fonts you use. 

Q: How will people find my Tumblr? 
A: Tag your posts. Tumblr is full of passionate communities of people who are constantly searching through tags for new posts about stuff they love. Your stuff could be that stuff. 

Q: Am I ready to download Tumblr, deepen my perspective, and forever change the way I think? 
A: Yes."	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	6	2270	0	1

First Words Deluxe	63316992	USD	4.99	7.0	4+	Games	38	5	1	1	"*** Finalist for the BestAppEver Award: Toddler Apps * **
 
The best-selling reading game for kids has gotten even better! We've added more words, more languages, and support for phonics. First Words Deluxe provides endless fun for the toddlers in your life, all while giving your child a head start on learning their letters and learning to spell words.

Now with Spanish, French, German, Japanese, plus US and UK English.

First Words Deluxe is toddler-tested and approved, with a user-interface designed specifically for the littlest of fingers.  The game includes over 150 words in five kid-friendly categories:

** Animals **
** Vehicles **
** Colors **
** Shapes **
** Words from around the house **

(Fewer words are shown when the phonics option is selected, because many English words are not spelled phonetically.  A total of 68 phonics words are included.)

A wide range of options let you tune the game to match your child's current skills and abilities.

If your child is old enough to ask for your phone, they're old enough for First Words Deluxe!

Here's what educators and reviewers have said about our First Words apps: 

“First Words is an app that teaches letters and words in fun and interactive way. Very easy to use these apps will help support your little ones learning with great illustrations and bright colors. Each app supports kids learning and encourages kids to explore and discover by revealing, rewarding and teaching.” 
-- Fun Educational Apps 

“Excellent - As a teacher, I love this game! Just what technology was meant to do!” 
-- iTunes Review 

“This app has great settings that let you control the level of difficulty for the child – either with lots of hints or almost none at all. The letters slide nicely into each word and when completed the child is rewarded by having the pictured animal enlarge and animate briefly.” 
--Carisa Kluver at Digital Stortyime 

“First Words Deluxe is a very straightforward word-building game. Words are either said letter by letter as they are dragged into the appropriate gray boxes or, if chosen in the settings, a smaller set of words can be sounded out with phonics. This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers.” 
--Common Sense Media 

“Looking to guide your toddler towards recognizing letters and how to spell words up to eight letters long? Then First Words Deluxe might be just what you are looking for. This pre-reader and spelling application encourages vocabulary development in a wide range of categories such as: vehicles, animals, at home, colors, and shapes.” 
--Andrea Gardner at Applicable2u 

""First Words is a great app -- as I said at the time, 'Leo loves First Words because it's fun and easy. I love it because he's learning to spell words, and the interface makes that learning error-free.'"" 
---Shannon Des Roches Rosa at Squidalicious

Six!	112238592	USD	0.0	2.2.0	4+	Games	38	5	1	1	"Six! is the latest title from Gram Games, makers of the global smash hits, 1010! and Merged!. This newest game is challenging, exciting, and even infuriating, at times. Like all great puzzles, Six! will keep you entertained for just a moment, or will keep you engaged for hours of fun.

The game concept is simple: there is a tower of blocks of various shapes, upon which sits another hexagonal block. The aim of the game is to move the hexagon down the screen to earn points. To do this, you tap the different blocks, which will make them disappear. The hexagon can then fall into the empty space left behind.

Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong. As the blocks are destroyed, the hexagon will start to wobble and roll, and the tower will begin to tilt. It is your job to keep the tower balanced, and the hexagon from gaining momentum and rolling of. To do so, remove blocks strategically, and ensure that their removal won’t throw everything off balance. If the hexagon tips into the abyss, it’s game over, and you’ll have to start over again.

Challenging, exciting, and surprisingly simple to play, Six! will have you hooked immediately. Like Gram’s other hits, the gameplay is simple and fun, but earning a spot on the leaderboard and competing with friends provides both a challenge, and a reward.

Key Features
●    Easy to learn, and fun to master gameplay
●    Challenge your friend’s high scores, challenge the world
●    Fun, colorful and engaging graphics
●    Exciting and addictive
●    Fun four hours, or just a few minutes"	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	4	1537	0	1

Sea Hero Quest	360306688	USD	0.0	1.3.0	4+	Games	37	5	17	1	"""It’s not just a game, it’s a quest to help scientists fight dementia!”

It sounds too good to be true but this really is a game, where simply by having loads of fun chasing creatures around magical seas and swamps, you can help to fight a disease that currently affects 45 million people worldwide. 

In fact playing SEA HERO QUEST for just 2 minutes will generate the equivalent of 5 hours of lab-based research data.

Created by GLITCHERS, presented by Deutsche Telekom and supported by scientists from University College London and University of East Anglia and the lovely people at Alzheimer’s Research, SEA HERO QUEST is an epic culmination of science and gameplay that will change the way dementia research is done forever. 

One of the first symptoms of dementia is loss of navigational skills. Doctors cannot differentiate between getting lost caused by disease and getting lost caused by natural ageing because a benchmark of “normal” does not exist. 

Until now … because as you play, your navigational data is tracked anonymously, stored securely and combined with every other player from around the globe, to create the world’s largest crowd sourced data set benchmarking human spatial navigation. This incredible resource will eventually lead to the development of new diagnosis tools and treatments for dementia. 

Navigate Arctic Rivers, Golden Shores, Mystic Marshes, Kano Reefs and High Roller storms, collect memories in your journal and chase magical creatures like Adorabella, Galleo and Octopoid. Collect as many starfish as possible and use them to customise your boat with a new lick of paint, a host of flags and much more!

Deutsche Telekom believes that life is for sharing, that’s why they are presenting SEA HERO QUEST – a game to help scientists fight dementia and work towards a future where memories are shared not lost before their time. 

Join the Quest and be a real-life hero.

Sea Hero Quest does not access, store or submit any HealthKit related data. Sea Hero Quest uses ResearchKit to ask optional scientific questions for further helping the research."	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	14	2092	0	1

Montessori Nature	199166976	USD	2.99	1.5.1	4+	Games	40	5	1	1	"This app offers a very realistic environment in which kids have to plant, nurture, harvest, and sell their crop (Paid app, no additional purchase required after download)

Nowadays, it is easy for children to become disconnected from nature in our bustling city landscapes. What if technology could help cultivate an engagement with nature that inspires curiosity, a love for its marvels, and in effect re-introduce our kids to the natural world? That is what Montessori Nature is all about!

Get your child excited about nature and maybe even give them a green thumb with Montessori Nature! Our realistic digital ecosystem will ignite children’s curiosity as they manage natural resources to grow fruit, veggies, and flowers. Not only will children acquire the critical thinking and organizational skills to make their seeds sprout and bloom, but they will also develop a consciousness of how food is produced, and why it’s important to manage natural resources.

Explore. Nurture. Grow.

FEATURES
100% customizable for endless hours of play 
100% educational: learn about plants’ life cycles and needs
100% safe for parents: sell the fruits of your labor to earn nature coins*
100% comprehensive:
Watch the bees pollinate the flowers to make honey 
Observe the difference in seasons
Protect your plants from pesky pests like rodents and ravens
Manage natural resources to nurture a lush garden 
100% motivating: expand and modernize your yard with watering robots, weather frogs, lamps, and more from the catalog
100% collaborative: work on your garden with up to 40 peers in real time** 
*Nature coins = digital currency earned and redeemed in the app 
**Specially designed for use in schools
According to Maria Montessori, a connection with nature is vital to a child’s development and spiritual well being. There is nothing more exciting than getting to taste a fresh tomato grown from seed to plant, digging in soil to discover creepy crawlers, or observing bumblebees as they pollinate a patch of marigolds. Montessori Nature prepares children for these experiences by offering a realistic simulation that can be transferred to real life!

FINAL FANTASY II	199450624	USD	7.99	1.1.1	9+	Games	38	5	6	1	"FINAL FANTASY II

FINAL FANTASY II is highly anticipated follow-up to the original FINAL FANTASY, released in Japan in 1988.

The game features the bitter and beautiful tale of four war-orphaned heroes who become embroiled in a conflict between the hostile Empire of Palamecia and the rebel resistance. By eschewing conventional leveling for a proficiency system that allows players to tailor their characters' growth and incorporating a key term memory system that makes dialogue integral to gameplay, this game sparked the spirit of innovation for which the series has become known.

This release also contains the bonus dungeons added to later editions of the game--the Soul of Rebirth and the Arcane Labyrinth.

“Amazing! If this app cost $25, it would be worth three times as much. Not only is it loaded with superbly crafted, spectacularly designed, and eye-pleasing frames, backgrounds, and layouts, it also works flawlessly to deliver top-notch and high quality finished product. The app is loaded with possibilities and opportunities and is simple to operate. If I had to pick a flaw or area for improvement, I would like to see more in the way of typography—fonts, drop-shadow, type effects. But this is minor compared to the stunning output this app produces. Definitely now one of my very favorites.”
Paul Soelberg

“Just Wow!!! I absolutely love this photo application. I somebody crossed it by accident and have not been able to stop using it. I upgraded to the Professional Edition for even more unique and beautiful frames and picture effects.”

Boom: Best Equalizer & Magical Surround Sound	88309760	USD	0.0	1.2.1	4+	Music	37	4	4	1	"Are you looking for a finer Equalizer? Do you crave for a better Bass Booster for your music? Do your ears desire a 3D Surround Sound feel coming out of the headphones? Here’s Boom, an app worthy of being your Default Music Player! 

YOU — the music lover. Your music defines YOU. Listening to low quality music and wondering if it could be better has brought you here. And now it's only a quick download that remains between YOU and an experience where you won't just listen to tracks, but will FEEL YOUR MUSIC!

 But before we get into details, here’s what the App Store Editor had to say about Boom —

 “With a sleek and easy-to-use interface, Boom: Music Player with Magical Surround Sound lets you free your music of that compressed feel, breathing new life into every nuance of your favourite tracks — just the way the artists intended. This app boasts a range of features to deliver that edge, including a mind blowing 3D Surround setting, equalisers and audio intensity effects designed to work with any headphones. Once you’ve heard your choicest tracks on Boom, there’ll be no going back.”

 Clearly, Boom is the best equalizer for your iPhones and iPads, worthy of being your default music player. Here’s why all the praise —

 — 3D IMMERSIVE MUSICAL EXPERIENCE:
Boom is based on our patent-pending 3D Virtual Surround Audio Engine which lets you immerse deep into a magical 3D Surround Sound experience. It allows every subtle note of your favorite tracks to express itself vividly and give you a realistic feel — just like you’d hear them in a concert. You may switch between any of your headphones, but the experience will remain the same incredible!

— PERSONALIZED EQUALIZER PRESETS:
When your taste of music meets our handcrafted equalizers, magic gets created. Each preset is curated to perfection to match the varied choices of your music.

— MULTIPLE LIBRARY ACCESS:
There should be no end to your music and so we enable you to access your music not only from the phone’s library but also from Dropbox and Google Drive. You can even download tracks to store on your phone and enjoy at will.

— AUDIO INTENSITY CONTROL, CUSTOMIZED PLAYLISTS, SLEEP and several other features give you complete control over your music.

So, whether the beat gets dropped or the tempo amplifies, with BOOM you are going to FEEL YOU MUSIC like you’ve never had!

Note: Technical restrictions prevent Boom to support live streaming tracks.

■#1 Paid Music Game Ranking (JP/KR) ■

""Steps"" is developed by the developer who was awarded the AppStore Best of 2015, and is certainly one of AppStore's hardest games ever.
It's super simple to play, but only a few would be able to reach the final stage.
Play hard to become the best gamer on Earth!

◆ So simple, so super hard
To play Steps, just tap the screen. But, although you can have a clear view of the stage, you will have hard time to clear.

◆ Warning: super hard!
Steps!'s difficulty might be beyond your imagination. Please be aware and try not to throw your smartphone onto the floor even if you can't clear.

◆ Super Hard, yet Fun
A stage designer with a music background prepared 36 delicious stages full of both thrill and looseness.

◆ More immersive than one of those ""impossibly hard video game""
The powerful beat and melody synchronizes with the character's motion to let you immerse in the game. You will get a great sense of accomplishment when you complete the super hard stages!

◆ Harder for people with good sense of rhythm?
Steps!'s stages contain many subtle rhythmical traps.  Just one jump can generate a whole different groove.  Enjoy a different sense of music than the stereotypical Music Games. Maybe you could train your sense of rhythm while playing those super hard stages?!

◆ Play more to train your reflexes!
Steps!'s play is very physical. With Steps!, Experience the same kind of thrills you felt in your childhood's outdoor play!

kubic	334576640	USD	1.99	1.6	4+	Games	37	5	12	1	"***** #1 Puzzle Game in over 20 Countries! *****

***** This quirky puzzle game bends the limits of space and reality to make you create structures that, in theory, should be impossible to replicate. - Pocket Gamer 8/10 *****

kubic is a unique optical illusion puzzle game based on M.C. Escher's art, impossible objects and other geometric designs. The object is to construct the goal configuration from a number of pieces.

Presented in a simple, clean design and minimalistic art, kubic is a premium game with over 60 escher-esque puzzles.

When you click on a piece, it pops to the front-most layer, and may overlap other pieces. When you combine the pieces, they do not merge. If there are extra pieces, you may hide them behind the others. If you are stuck on a puzzle you can simply skip it and re-visit at a later time. Rest assured, all puzzles can be solved but beware, some puzzles are hard! Just take your time...

If you truly get stuck, there is a in-game hint system. You can use it to get started or even get the whole puzzle solved.

Tip: It helps to plan ahead and build figures from back to front.

Levels divided in 6 groups:
• Ocean (Blue) - ""2D""  Shapes are basically two-dimensional arrangements.
• Desert (Orange) - ""3D""  Shapes appear to be three-dimensional, but remember to think in two dimensions.
• Mountain (Purple) - ""Convex/Concave""  These optical illusions are inspired by Escher's famous ""Convex and Concave"" lithograph.
• Sky (Green) - ""Up/Down""  These optical illusions are inspired by the Penrose Triangle featured in Escher's lithograph ""Waterfall”.
• Escher (Mixed) - Based on letter designs that spell out MC ESCHER.
• Print - Based on the printable magazine version of Convex-Concave puzzles.

Kubic is localized and supports 12 languages including English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional), Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish

Game supports iCloud for progress syncing between devices.

Convex Concave puzzles from the Heaven and Earth game are included with permission. The puzzles were designed by Scott Kim, Puzzlemaster (scottkim.com), and the Heaven & Earth team.

The unparalleled physics engine and unexpected power-ups give you a level of control that you have to play to believe. Launch off an enormous jump, land on your rear wheel, hit the throttle, and leave your opponent in a spray of dirt—then brag about it on Facebook and Twitter! Mad Skills Motocross is fun for novices but deep enough for nearly endless competitive high-level play. You’ll need to master wheelies, stoppies, nitro, rocket boots, backflips, front flips, and much more to truly be the best.

OUR STORY

With electronic music, musician usually write the music in software and the computer is the interpret. After years as electronic musicians we were boarded by filling endless spreadsheet to make music. In 2002, we were touring in Europe, having no fun on stage, while seeing amateur rock band in their garage getting lots of it. We then decided to create Herrmutt Lobby as a research lab for live electronic music.

10 years later the band has become a collective with musicians, software developers, electronic engineers, … and our hard drives and shelves are full of homemade instruments, softwares and tools. Our music and concerts are true live act, the kind that you can rock or fail, the one with danger on stage. 

Then we discovered that all that technology we created was the magical tools that help people without musical knowledge to feel what it’s like to rock the house. We used it in workshops, art installation and finally we made PlayGround. A platform where the public, no matter their skill level, can play, all by themself, their own live version of tracks made by hand picked great artists from around the world.

We’re now one of the Best App of 2016 and we’re featured as a demo app in Apple Store. But the most heartwarming for us is the awesome feedback we get from all the music enthusiast who found joy making music with PlayGround.

We will be glad to hear your feedback and suggestions. Let us know on Facebook, Twitter, or email us at …"	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	37	3736	0	0

MLB Manager 2016	180300800	USD	4.99	6.1.23	12+	Games	37	5	1	1	"Guide your favorite Major League Baseball franchise to glory! MLB Manager 2016, officially licensed by MLB and the MLBPA, is based on the award-winning Out of the Park Baseball series.  

""With a great menu system driving the entire game, excellent AI, and the ability to micro-manage almost everything you could dream of in a sports game, it's hard to want anything else of a mobile baseball management sim."" (Touch Arcade)

MLB Manager 2016 features a living world that uses the same realistic simulation engine found in Out of the Park Baseball, the best-selling and best-rated baseball management game of all time. Each MLB team in the game features its actual 40-man projected 2016 Opening Day roster. The player ratings are based on the ZiPS player projection system created by famous baseball analyst Dan Szymborski.

New features in MLB Manager 2016 include:
- 2016 Opening Day MLB rosters 
- Offical MLBPA license
- New game logs
- New trade difficulty setting
- Recoded and improved AI throughout the game

The game offers three gameplay modes:
- Major League Baseball Game: Choose your favorite MLB team and play out the 2016 season and beyond. There is no limit, guide your team into the future! Will Bryce Harper dominate the National League again? How will David Price perform in his new home ballpark Fenway Park? Will rising star Corey Seager win the Rookie of the Year award in the NL? How will the young guns in the AL develop, among them Carlos Correa, Miguel Sano and Francisco Lindor? Will the Kansas City Royals repeat as World Series Champions and build a dynasty?
- Fictional Game: MLB Manager creates one of four fictional baseball worlds and populates it with fresh players and clubs. Select a team and build a dynasty from scratch.
- Historical MLB Game: Choose one of three past MLB seasons -- 1919, 1939, or 2012 -- and see if it produces a different outcome. Additional historical seasons are available as in-app purchase for $0.99 each, $4.99 for a 10-season bundle, or $19.99 for all available seasons (115 in total!). International currency conversion rates may apply.

After selecting a gameplay mode, choose a team and handle every aspect of managing it:
- Manage your team, set lineups, depth charts, pitching staff and more!
- Call the shots from the dugout and watch the games unfold.
- Step into the shoes of the General Manager: Negotiate contracts, sign free agents, put together trades, draft the next superstar, promote players from the minors etc.

During games, the play-by-play text is generated from a huge database of tens of thousands of lines that bring the action alive. Bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, you're down by two runs and you have your best hitter stepping to the plate against your opponent's rock-solid closer ... What will happen next?

During the season, news tickers bring you headlines from around the leagues! Your biggest rival just pulled off a blockbuster trade with the trading deadline looming ... How will you respond?

As MLB Manager's living world evolves, players develop their careers, age, and eventually retire, with a possible spot in the OOTP Hall of Fame waiting for them. New players drafted by you and groomed in the minors take their place and become the next generation of superstars.

MLB Manager 2016 is the ultimate game for baseball fans!

Craft The World is a unique sandbox strategy game, the mix of Dungeon Keeper, Terraria and Dwarf Fortress. Explore a random generated world populated by dangerous creatures, build a dwarf fortress, gather resources, and craft all the items, weapons, and armor you need. 

Pocket Edition contains all 4 worlds of the Steam version:
http://store.steampowered.com/app/248390

GOD-SIMULATION
You control a tribe of dwarves by giving them commands to dig in certain places, attack enemy creatures, and build houses and other structures. You'll need to provide your dwarves food and clothing, as well as help them with magic when fighting against other inhabitants of the world. You start the game with one dwarf and gain additional dwarves as your experience level increases.

SANDBOX GAME
Each game level has many layers of earth to explore, from the sky down to boiling subterranean lava. The level is randomly generated as an island, restricted by natural boundaries: oceans on the edges, lava beneath it, and the sky above. Other features include day and night and changing weather conditions. The worlds differ in size, humidity, temperature, terrain, and flora and fauna. Abandoned halls and rooms with treasure are hidden somewhere deep within the islands.

CRAFTING
One feature of the game is a user-friendly system of recipes for crafting. The recipes are organized and easily accessible. You can craft dozens of different items: building blocks for houses, furniture, decorations, weapons, armor, ammunition, and food for your dwarves.

RTS
At the outset you find the recipes for basic tools and items, and build a small house with places to sleep and eat. Then, the size of the tribe increases and catches the attention of other inhabitants of the world. Most of them are night creatures and dwell underground. The worlds are full of fantasy creatures like zombies, skeletons, goblins, beholders, ghosts, giant spiders, and others. Some of them pay little attention to the dwarves, as long as the dwarves do not come into their field of vision. Others gather into quite large groups and try to break into the dwarves’ residence.

TOWER DEFENSE
Especially dangerous are the waves of monsters that appear from time to time from portals. So, do not neglect to build a safe haven with strong walls and numerous trapdoors, cells, firing towers, and secret passageways.

MAGIC
As a divine being, you possess various spells. You can speed up the movement of the dwarves, open small portals, illuminate dark caves to scare away monsters, evoke natural magic in the form of rain or tree growth, hurl fireballs at the monsters’ heads, and find useful resources and hidden rooms underground, thereby helping to speed up resource extraction, exploration of the world, and the population growth of your assistants."	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	32	2836	1	0

Ship Finder	22948864	USD	4.99	9.0.1	4+	Navigation	37	1	1	1	"Ship Finder shows live moving ships on a worldwide map. The intuitive design combined with incredible performance puts you in control. Watch in full screen, view in AR, search, add filters and so much more!

Ship Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.

Our incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!
Simply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.
Powerful features such as filters, search and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).

Add and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.

You can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. 

Ship Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.

Ship Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.

Our global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.

Pinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help.

""Kids are so excited about saving the Snortles that they don't realize they're building core addition and multiplication skills along the way."" - Common Sense Media
________________________________

Skip Counting provides the foundation for math fluency in calculation, number sense and as the basis of multiplication and division. The award winning Jump Numbers is a flexible and fun skip counting game to excite and engage mathematicians of all ages and ability.  

The Snortles lived happily in their favorite volcano until the day it popped! Now they’re scattered and floating in the sea. Jump from one number to the next in a sequence, saving Snortles and earning beach balls as you go. Squish numbers together to make the next number on your path.

Watch out for Stompers and fuses or they'll send your Snortles flying!

- Option to turn off Stompers and fuses (time pressure) for a more relaxing math journey 
- Unlimited user accounts
________________________________

SKILLS AND DIFFICULTY

The default mode of play in Jump is adaptive difficulty. This means the game will automatically adjust the difficulty for each player. The game starts out easy, counting by 1s and 2s, but before you know it, you may find yourself counting by 7s, 8s or 9s and things can add up quickly! The more Snortles you save and the more math you do, the more challenging the game will become. 

If you want more fine-grained control for targeted math practice, you can “customize skills” from the options menu:

- Choose the specific “Count by” numbers a player is presented with, or play the original adaptive game.
- You can also choose a random “Start at” number for a much tougher challenge.
 ________________________________

UNLIMITED USER ACCOUNTS:

Add as many users as you like. Individual skill level and progress are saved within each player profile.

Santa's Naughty or Nice Scan-O-Matic Free	39937024	USD	0.0	3.8	4+	Entertainment	38	5	1	1	"This is the best ""Naughty or Nice"" scanning app available because YOU control the results (secretly)!

A great 3-in-1 Christmas app for parents to help keep their kids mindful of Santa Claus throughout the holiday season! Kids behave when they know mom or dad can pull out their iPhone or iPod Touch and instantly check to see if they're being naughty or nice!

**Note to owners who updated: If the scanner still freezes, simply delete the old version from your device and download the latest version from the iTunes store.

It has three separate functions:

Naughty or Nice Scanning - Secretly determine the outcome ahead of time by how you tap the RESET button. The candy cane needle oscillates and then tells you if you (or you friends or kids) are ""Naughty"" or ""Nice."" See the secret below!  Features TWO modes (Finger Scan or Scan Button)

Christmas Countdown - Want to know how many days until Christmas? How about how many hours or even minutes? Press the green button to switch the count! The countdown clock even takes leap years into consideration, so you'll be able to use this for years to come!

Santa Watching Light - Here's a great way to really throw off kids: tell them Santa is watching and then show them that the Santa Watching light is ON. Again, the light is secretly and completely controlled by the user or parent with no random chance involved.

Features:

*A totally parent-controlled ""Naughty or Nice"" feature to remind the kids to behave.
*Different scan results EACH time (be sure to tap the RESET button on the appropriate side)
*Good for parents of children or adults who want to scan their partner as naughty!
*Steampunk-themed brass, leather and wood graphics that add a sense of fun and reality to the app.
*Real button clicks, gear turns and other professional sound effects.
*Blinking lights add a holiday feel.
*Three apps combined in one: Naughty or Nice detector, Christmas Countdown and Santa Watching indicator.

Of course, you can also use this at holiday parties, Christmas gatherings among friends and whenever else you want to show people the amazing (and fake) capabilities of your iPhone!

FOR PARENTS ONLY (How To Control Your Results)

Naughty or Nice Scanning - You control the results by tapping the RESET button. A tap on the LEFT side of the RESET button gives a Naughty outcome when scanned, a tap on the RIGHT side of the RESET button gives a Nice outcome. A tap right in the center gives a random result! The farther right and farther left you tap will tend to give ""Nicer"" or ""Naughtier"" results.

Hint: Watch the center light: it will be green if the result is going to be Nice and red if the result is going to be Naughty.

Christmas Countdown - Just hit the green button to scroll through Hours, Days and Minutes until midnight on Christmas Eve!

Santa Watching Light - To turn the light on and off simply double-tap the light.

Video demo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sVPfzb7oIg

SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENTS: Please test this a few times without your kids to be sure you know how it works. It's no fun scanning a good kid and accidentally having it come up as ""naughty"" because you forgot to tap the right side of the RESET button ahead of the scan.

Concrete Jungle	256277504	USD	4.99	1.18	12+	Games	37	5	1	1	"A follow up to the puzzle hit 'MegaCity'! Concrete Jungle is a new take on the city building genre that swaps micro-management for a more strategic and puzzle-orientated style of city planning.

You have a deck of selected cards which you can use to place buildings. Each building will affect it's surroundings in different ways. The aim of the game is to clear city blocks by gathering the required number of points from your residents, giving more room to build. As the city grows, bigger and better new buildings can be added to your deck!

As you get opportunities to hone and refine your deck, residents will demand more from you. You'll find yourself inadvertently creating zoning puzzles- playing against your own past planning decisions.

Alternatively engage in competitive city planning against challenging AI or local players. Take it in turns to place buildings in the same city and battle over the affection of your citizens!

* Over 230 cards available and no micro-transactions!
* 8 Playable characters each with their own skill trees, unique cards and play style.
* Hilarious fully voice-acted story mode!
* Competitive city planning featuring challenging AI in 'Versus' mode.

Paribus - Rebates When Prices Drop	92841984	USD	0.0	2.9.0	4+	Finance	37	5	1	1	"Get money when prices drop, effortlessly.   

Stores change their prices all the time – and many of them have price guarantees. Paribus gets you money when prices drop. So if you buy something online from one of these retailers and it goes on sale later, Paribus automatically works to get you the price adjustment. 

 Paribus monitors prices on all kinds of items, from clothing to electronics, food and household goods. The merchants whose prices it monitors include some of the largest online stores, such as Amazon, BestBuy, Macy’s, Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Newegg, GAP, Banana Republic, Athleta, Old Navy, Staples, J.Crew, Bonobos, Sephora, Walmart, Target, Zappos, Neiman Marcus, Overstock, Saks Fifth Avenue, Piperlime, Office Depot, Apple, Costco and Kohl’s.  

Paribus gets you cash back when you shop online, effortlessly. Link your mailbox, send your receipts there, and Paribus will track the prices of what you bought, detect coupons and price-match opportunities, and actually get you the cash you’re owed from the retailers directly. 

 While many of the big online retailers offer a price guarantee, getting a refund can be a painful process. Retailers’ policies are often confusing, and you have to do a lot of leg work to track prices, figure out whether you qualify for a price adjustment, and then file claims one-by-one.  For some, it is not worth the effort.  

How does Paribus work? 
It’s very simple. Sign-in with the email you use for shopping and link any missing shopping accounts. Paribus will detect the receipts in your mailbox and track your purchases to detect price drops, missed coupons and price match opportunities to save you money. If there are potential savings, Paribus will check the retailer policies and communicate with their customer service on your behalf to get you paid. 

 How much does it cost? 
Try it! It is always free to enroll in the service.  If we get you a refund, we only charge 25% of what we actually save you (no upfront fees). 

NEW: Delivery Monitoring by Paribus. This new feature automatically detects when items from select online retailers are delivered later than promised, and effortlessly files claims to make it right for the customer. If an online order is delivered later than the retailer promised, Paribus can automatically do the legwork of contacting the merchant to request compensation. Through the delivery monitoring feature, Paribus users have received everything from full or partial refunds of shipping costs to store credit, and even one-month extensions of their memberships in retailer rush-shipping programs.

 Need more reasons to join Paribus? 
 - Paribus has already collected millions of dollars in savings for our customers. 
 - Paribus was featured at TechCrunch Disrupt (hi Silicon Valley fans!), Yahoo, Business Insider, Product Hunt and BGR.

  Note: Paribus requires secure access to your mailbox in order to track receipts. Some merchants do not provide itemized purchase information in their e-receipts. If you’d like Paribus to track purchases from these merchants, you will have the option to link your merchant shopping. This will allow Paribus to pull your order information and help you save on these purchases too!   

We take security seriously. Paribus transmits all information over SSL and uses bank-level encryption to store sensitive data. It has been tested and certified to be secure by McAfee, the world's largest dedicated security company.  

Paribus does not live in your inbox. We place custom webhooks to detect and pull ONLY receipts from stores based on sender and subject alone without examining the email contents. So your inbox contents stays fully under the security and supervision of your email provider."	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	34	3735	1	0
Shift Worker	7344128	USD	1.99	1.5.4	4+	Productivity	40	0	1	0	"Shift Worker is an iPhone/iPod Touch application designed for people who need a quick and easy way to enter and view their shifts.

A traditional calendar is not always ideal for shift workers. Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.

Shift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.

Entering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!

In addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. 

Shift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.

FEATURES:

- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types
- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds

I am very pleased with it. I'll be recommending this to all my friends. It's a great way to get the juices of the mind flowing. I don't know what the actual standard test consists of, however I can imagine it's pretty similar to this apps knowledge base! In closing -Sending my thanks to the developers!""

""I can't believe all these people bragging that they got IQ's of 135 and 140. The average is 100. Obviously, most of you people are lying. 3% of people have an IQ of 125 and over. 0.39% have an IQ over 140. One things I say, is that, 'the person who tells everyone how smart they are probably are not.' My sister is is pretty smart and has an IQ of 128. She's going to MIT. I think you people bragging about your iq probably aren't the smartest. If you were really smart, you'd know everyone would just say your lying and not tell everyone your IQ. I think it's a good, accurate app because my sister took a really long iq test and got the exact same score.""

""I made the official Mensa test online few years ago and got 138. This time I have 130 with the app. I think it's accurate but it always depends on how you focus to the test and the time spent to answer the 39 questions. Good app overall.""

Touch Notation	121240576	USD	11.99	1.1.001	4+	Music	37	5	2	1	"Touch Notation is a powerful musical score creation app that allows anyone to enjoy writing music using touch gestures.

In Japan, Touch Notation was selected as one of the ‘App Store Best of 2014’ apps, and held the No.1 spot in the iPad Paid App index for music apps for over two weeks.

Touch Notation is available in free and full versions, allowing musicians to experience most of the app’s features at no cost.

Up until now, musical score creation software has relied upon dragging individual notes from a palette onto staves.  By contrast, Touch Notation allows musicians to draw directly onto the score using a finger or touch pen, and have their work immediately appear as beautifully written notation, then played back using the app’s 30 built-in instrument voices.

-	A wide-range of functions accessible from a cleanly designed, intuitive user interface.
-	Ability to enter musical expressions for adjusting tempo and dynamics.
-	Convenient transpose feature for raising/lowering the pitch of the entire score.
-	Output scores using Air Print, or save to Dropbox in PDF, SMF, MusicXML, and ScoreMaker formats.

Touch Notation allows the following musical symbols to be entered by hand:

-	Note, Rest (including dotted and double-dotted), Long Rest, Beam, Tuplet (Triplet)
-	Grace Note
-	Accidental, Tie, Slur
-	Accent, Staccato, Tenuto, Fermata
-	Trill, sfz, Arpeggio, Pedal, Senza
-	Metronome symbol
-	Crescendo, Decrescendo
-	Dynamics symbols (ppp~fff)
-	Octave symbol
-	Repeat brackets
-	Repeat marks (D.C./Fine/D.S./Segno/Coda/to Coda)
-	Clefs (Treble Clef/Bass Clef/C Clef/Percussion Clef)
-	Key signature
-	Time signature
-	Bar lines (repeat marks)
-      Abbreviation

Other musical expressions (‘Dolce’, ‘Tranquillo’, etc.) can be added using text input, while comments and memos can also be written freehand directly onto the score.

* Entering rhythm notation, tab notation etc. is not supported.
* Older devices may experience stuttering when playing complicated scores with many simultaneous notes.  Users are recommended to test the free version of Touch Notation in order to assess the app’s performance on their device."	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	14	2147	1	1

Dungeon Raid is a puzzle RPG, a blend of puzzle game with roleplaying mechanics. Your mission is to trace a path through a set of matching tiles, but watch out – you may be attacked by enemies who improve as fast as you do.

As you go, the object is to collect as many resources as you can, like gold and experience. Get enough points and you can buy or upgrade equipment and level up. All the while, remember to avoid those nasty enemy skull tiles and fight them off for as long as you possibly can. And don't get too greedy, or you risk being overwhelmed!

The higher you go in a Dungeon Raid game, the more strategy you’re going to need to match a greater number of tiles, grab bonuses and stay ahead of those evil adversaries. Never forget that they improve as the game continues.

Keep your wits about you as you play Dungeon Raid. As you level up, there are many trade offs to consider and complimentary combinations of skills to be chosen. If you’re not used to the tense pace of the higher levels, go ahead and start on easy difficulty. That gives you the chance to play the game in a more relaxed way, and watch how powerful your avatar can become.

Regardless of your skill level, you’ll never get bored with Dungeon Raid because there’s so much going on! There are hundreds of items to collect, a growing list of character skills and many different strategies for you to use. You’ll be itching to play just one more turn, just one more game for hours and days on end.

Arise, lowly skeleton, and rescue the Princess from the Dark Lord's castle!

You are a nameless skeleton in the Dark Lord's army. After a chance encounter with the Princess, who was abducted to become the dreaded Dark Lord's wife, you found yourself setting her free. Guide the Princess from the shadows in Skeleton Form, switching to Hero Form when it's time to mount a gallant offense! Can you spring the Princess from the castle?

・The Game
Aid the Princess in her flight from the Dark Lord's castle, guarding her from traps and enemies as you strike an artful balance between both Skeleton and Hero Forms--each boasting a palette of unique abilities and traits. Can you safely guide your royal counterpart to the flower at the end of each area? Succeed, and the fairytale will further unfold!

Deep gameplay and whimsical storytelling come together in a resplendent production you can pick up and play--as well as save and stop--anytime you please! Equal parts action and puzzle, a new kind of fairytale awaits you!

・The Story
Once upon a time, the Princess of a faraway land ruled in tranquility--until she was kidnapped by the scheming Dark Lord.

The Dark Lord was bent on making the unwilling Princess his bride. Locking her away in his castle, he ordered a skeleton to keep a stern watch over his prize. The docile henchmen kept to his orders... at least at first.

The weeping beauty before the skeleton conjured strange feelings. Yes, he wanted to return the Princess to her former life, away from the Dark Lord's marital machinations! And so it was the lowly skeleton betrayed his master and set the Princess free.

But can the pair make it out of the castle in one piece? Our story begins..."	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	6	1908	1	1

Oje, ich wachse!	26168320	USD	1.99	6.1.8	4+	Health & Fitness	37	4	1	1	"Der weltweite Bestseller unter den Baby-Apps von “Oje, ich wachse!” ist ein personalisierter Wochenkalender zur mentalen Entwicklung Ihres Babys. Er bietet Ihnen umfassende Informationen zu den Entwicklungssprüngen und empfindlichen Phasen Ihres Babys.

DIE WELTWEIT BESTE APP
=============================
-	Als “Coolste App für Mütter” ausgezeichnet.
-	Durch Apple zum Gewinner unter den Top 10 der “Jahresbesten 2016” in Australien, GB, den Niederlanden und vielen anderen Ländern bestimmt.
-	Gewinner des Verbraucherpreises “Consumer Choice & Gold Award”; verliehen durch MumIi. 
-	“AppRx Awards”-Gewinner unter den 10 besten Gesundheits-Apps für Kinder.
-	Gewinner der “Besten App auf Elternwunschlisten”; verliehen durch den britischen Gesundheitsdienst NHS.
-	“Best App Ever Wards 2013 & 2014”-Gewinner in den Bereichen Gesundheit & Fitness.
-	Top-25-App in den Bereichen Gesundheit & Fitness in den meisten Ländern rund um den Globus.

KERNMERKMALE
=============================
Behalten Sie die mentale Entwicklung Ihres Babys im Auge.
Erfahren Sie alles zu den Entwicklungssprüngen und empfindlichen Phasen Ihres Babys.
Lesen Sie den Bestseller “Oje, ich wachse!” mithilfe der App.
Verfassen Sie Notizen zu diversen Themen Ihrer Wahl.

Diese App dient Ihnen als mobile Version des Kalenderdiagramms zu den Entwicklungssprüngen von “Oje, ich wachse!” auf einen Blick. Während das Buch detailliert und leicht verständlich die erstaunlichen Veränderungen beschreibt, die Ihr Baby im Rahmen seiner Entwicklung durchläuft, ist diese App Ihr perfekter Begleiter in Kalenderform, was die mentalen Entwicklungssprünge Ihres Babys während seiner ersten 20 Lebensmonate betrifft. Indem Sie verstehen, was im Kopf Ihres Babys vor sich geht, können Sie ihm helfen, den jeweiligen Sprung besser zu meistern und seine Entwicklung zu fördern. 

Die “Oje, ich wachse!”-App hilft frischgebackenen Eltern:
 
-	indem sie kalendarisch angibt, wann der nächste mentale Entwicklungssprung des Babys bevorsteht.
-	zu verstehen, was ihr Baby nach dem jeweiligen mentalen Sprung begreifen und lernen kann.
-	zu welchen Dingen ihr Baby nach dem Sprung befähigt ist und...
-	zu erkennen, wie sie ihrem Baby dabei helfen können.

Diese App dient frischgebackenen Eltern außerdem als praktisches Erinnerungstool für den jeweiligen Zeitpunkt, an dem ihrem Baby erneut eine Veränderung im Rahmen seiner Hirnentwicklung bzw. ein “Sprung” bevorsteht. Das Baby macht einen bedeutenden Fortschritt in seiner mentalen Entwicklung und mit jedem Sprung vorwärts kommt eine drastische Veränderung in der Art und Weise, wie das Baby seine Umgebung wahrnimmt. Da diese Sprünge unvermittelt eintreten, können dem Kind diese “neue Welt” und die neu erworbenen Fertigkeiten manchmal beängstigend erscheinen. So äußert sich die Entwicklung zu Beginn möglicherweise in schlechtem Schlaf, Appetitmangel, Weinen, anhänglichem Verhalten und schlechter Laune, was Mütter und Väter gleichermaßen als erschöpfend und frustrierend empfinden.

Internationale Experten bewerten “Oje, ich wachse!” als: “Überaus praktisches und unterhaltsam verfasstes Werk und Tor zur Welt eines Babys während seiner ersten anderthalb Lebensjahre. Van de Rijt und Plooij haben dieselben verletzlichen Phasen im Leben eines Kleinkindes beobachtet und identifiziert, auf die ich selbst unabhängig von ihren Forschungsergebnissen gestoßen bin und in meinem Buch “Touchpoints” (Perseus Books Group) eingehe. Die geschilderten Beobachtungen und praktischen Tipps der Autoren sind ausgezeichnet.” – Univ.-Prof. Dr. (im Ruhestand) T. Berry Brazelton von der medizinischen Fakultät Harvard

Haftungsausschluss: Diese App wurde mit größter Sorgfalt entwickelt. Weder Entwickler noch Autor haften für Schäden, die möglicherweise aus Ungenauigkeiten oder mangelnden Informationen heraus entstehen."	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	16	3824	0	1

Shell by Bellabeat - Baby Heartbeat Listener	58326016	USD	0.0	1.13	4+	Lifestyle	25	0	1	1	"Listen to your baby’s heartbeat.

""Ground breaking technology” Wired

""Completely amazing” Fox News

""Hear Your Unborn Baby's Heartbeat” Mashable

Shell is the ultimate prenatal device. It slides easily onto your phone and turns it into a baby heartbeat listener. Using groundbreaking innovation you can listen, record, and share clips of your baby’s heartbeat with loved ones and enhance your bonding experience.

Shell first of its kind, non-invasively captures sounds from the womb and isolates the heartbeat.

An Experience Unlike Any Other.

Shell is inspired by the Pinard horn, a centuries-old method used by midwives. Taking modern day developments, Shell brings you a safe and non-invasive way to hear your baby’s heartbeat without the use of ultrasound waves.


Making this major life event interactive, Shell provides a unique way to announce a pregnancy with recording and sharing features and also offers a way to keep your inner circle connected with your growing bundle of joy as it progresses toward birth.

The most recent addition to Shell is the kick-counter: an easy, non-invasive test that you can do at home to check your baby's well-being. The test helps you monitor your baby’s movement to alert you to any decreased activity, generally considered to be sign of potential problems.

Key features:
-Find and listen to your baby’s heartbeat
-Record and store an unlimited number of tracks
-Share the recordings with loved ones
-Enhance the bonding experience between you and your baby
-Kick counter test

Key components:    
-Shell filters out ambient noise to accurately enable listening
-Easy and safe to use.
-Non-invasive technology enables you to safely use your Shell


IMPORTANT NOTES

App only works with the Shell accessory.

We like to ensure the safety of all moms and babies. Shell is safe to use but as a precaution, please place your phone in airplane mode.

Before using the Shell application take the device out of its case or cover in order to eliminate any false ""beating"" sounds.

For best results it is recommended to use Shell from week 30. In some instances the baby’s heartbeat can be heard even earlier.

Please note the Shell is NOT a medical device and is NOT intended to replace any medical advice given by a physician.

Shell is supported on the following iPhone devices: 5S, 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, SE, 7 and 7 Plus."	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	44	2367	0	0

Lifeline 2	81724416	USD	1.99	1.4	9+	Games	37	5	1	1	"The original Lifeline took the App Store by storm, reaching #1 Top Paid Game on iPhone and Apple Watch in 29 countries. Its compelling mix of real-time storytelling and Dave Justus’s suspenseful writing continues to capture the imaginations of countless players worldwide. 

Lifeline 2 raises the bar with a new story almost twice as long as the original, with many more choices and paths to explore. Lifeline 2 features a 28-minute original soundtrack and is fully optimized for watchOS 2, delivering the best Lifeline experience on Apple Watch yet.

The second story in the Lifeline series connects you with Arika, a young woman on a deadly quest to avenge her parents and rescue her long-lost brother. Your choices will keep her alive and help her succeed as she faces mortal danger on her way to a final, fateful showdown against the forces that threaten all of humanity.

Lifeline stories play out in real time. As Arika travels to complete her quest, notifications deliver new messages throughout your day. Keep up as they come in, or catch up later when you’re free. You can even respond to Arika directly from your Apple Watch or your iPhone lock screen, without launching into the app on your phone.

After completing any story branch, you can rewind to earlier parts of the story, or speed through parts you’ve already read. See what happens when you make a different choice: will you guide Arika virtuously, or cut corners to gain an edge? Seemingly simple actions can deeply affect the outcome. 

Arika’s story, and the fate of the world, depend on your judgment. You will face the consequences together, because Arika is relying on YOU. 


Lifeline 2 features no in-app purchases and no ads. An Internet connection is not required.

Praise for the original Lifeline:

“[A] surprising iPhone and Apple Watch bestseller is pushing the boundaries of fiction” - boingboing.net

“This is the best game on the Apple Watch” - Time.com

“I’ve played many games that I find engrossing, but Lifeline may be one of the first that changed the way I thought about my daily routine, which leapt off the screen and became a part of my lived experience.” - Eli Cymet, Gamezebo

“For a few brief hours I cared – really cared – about the fate of a completely fictional character. I don’t think any other game I’ve played has made me feel that way before.” - Matt Thrower, PocketGamer

What people are saying:

""Ride-sharing programs like Lyft are providing commuters with less expensive and more social ways to get around. Users log into the app, specify where they’re heading, and a background-checked driver picks them up for less than a typical cab ride."" - TODAY Show

“Lyft is a real community — with both the drivers and riders being inherently social — making real friendships and saving money.” - Time

""In a city where taxis can be scarce and… black town cars are rampant but expensive, Lyft has quickly gained visibility due to low prices and quirky branding."" - Ad Age

""Lyft's focus on the everyman has recently extended to the wildly successful Lyft Line carpool service aimed at commuters, which offers discounts of 30% to 60% for sharing a Lyft ride with others."" - Fast Company

For Lyft drivers, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

Escalation is a downward spiral.

Pick one of the big nuclear players – from known Superpowers to an upstart hellraiser like North Korea – and plan your strategy wisely: Limited but clever options let you as the leader of your superpower steer your nation’s fate: Expand to other countries, build bombs or debuild in order to restructure your arsenal. Or use research to widen your options, such as: Ability to act quicker and build bigger bombs, better recon on your enemies actions, automated self-defense-sequences and many more.

Whether you’re a bloodthirsty warmonger  or a tree-hugging hippie – it’s time to put your cards on the table. A quick and fun game with beautiful graphics, FIRST STRIKE shows you how little it takes to heat things up. With the tip of your finger you can control the destiny of the precious and vulnerable rock floating through space, the rock we call mothership Earth.

Go back in time with King, Queen and Jack as you play the ultimate card game. It's the same game of Solitaire you know and love, but just more beautiful.

Never played Solitaire? The object of the game is to sort the cards by suit and rank from low (Ace) to high (King) into four stacks, by revealing all the cards. After the shuffle, seven piles of cards are laid out from left to right, with each sequential pile containing one more card than the pile before it. The top card of each pile is face-up with the remaining cards used as the dealing pile placed above the rest. The game starts when the first move is made. To make a move, the player selects a card from one of the seven piles or the dealing pile to create fanned stacks of cards of descending rank and alternating colors. The player can move full or partial groups of cards in order to access others ultimately completing the four stacks.

Play the standard one-card or three-card draw. Stuck on a move? Use the hint button to show you the move, or click New Game to restart or deal a new hand.

The goal of Evil Minds is for you and your friends to guess a secret Evil Word based on clues that are either yelled or acted out by each other. The game is played in person with a single phone and has been known to cause players' teeth to fall out from laughing too hard!

Unlike Adult Charades, Bottoms Up, and Heads Up, Evil Minds features two unique game modes: a Clue Giver mode, and a Word Guesser mode. Play with the over 2,000 Evil Words in the game, or write your own. It never gets old!

__HOW TO GUESS WORDS__
1. Gather one or more friends.
2. Hold your phone up in front of you, facing the group, so you can't see the Evil Word on the screen.
3. Your friends will start to gesticulate and yell clues at you like wild animals, giving you hints until you guess the Evil Word!
4. If you succeed, tilt the phone downward to gain 1 point. If you fail to guess the Evil Word, tilt the phone upward to pass.
5. After the round is over, pass the phone to the next person!

__HOW TO GIVE CLUES__
1. Gather one or more friends.
2. Hold your phone in front of you, carefully hiding it so that only you can see the Evil Word on the screen.
3. Begin to gesticulate and yell like a wild animal, giving your friends clues until they guess the Evil Word.
4. Tap Next if you succeed, or Skip if you fail.
5. After the round is over, pass the phone to the next person!

However, you can still design and share skins if you don't play these editions. The app does NOT support the creation of custom skins for Xbox edition at this time (it's impossible for us to add because the games don't support them!), although if the game allows it in the future, we will defiantly add definitely for it. 

This version of the app may pop-up to tell you about important announcements from 57Digital Ltd. However, this will only happen in rare cases and will only ever pop-up once.

""It’s the only iPad game to ever make me consider my relationship with humanity."" — wired.com

""Coolest puzzle game ever!"" — PewDiePie

Dreii is a puzzling game about skill, logic and friendship. It subtly connects players in real-time across the world, to help one another in a battle against gravity.

The mission is simple. But once again, things get in the way... Explosives, thunderstorms, completely incompetent colleagues. Oh, and did we mention gravity?

Features
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Languages: Drei features an universal communication tool which allows to speak to other players, from wherever they are. Drei supports 19 languages: Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Rhaeto-Romanic, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Swiss-German and Turkish.

Optimized: Dreii plays beautifully on the iPad and iPhone. From the beginning it was engineered and optimized for Apple's tablet, taking advantage of the intuitive touch controls, the pretty display, and the possibility to use the screen in landscape and portrait mode.

Sound: One of the best thing about Drei is how it sounds. Each character has its very own instrument. And as the characters work together they form Drei's unique universal orchestra, creating their very own musical landscape, inspired by archaic instruments and ancient melodies. All instruments were performed and recorded live with some of Switzerland's finest musicians.

Uber Swiss Design: Drei is designed to be as universal as possible. However, in a strange way it's also very Swiss, where it was made. Clean typography, minimalism with attention to detail. It's Swiss Design heritage, we can't deny it.

Technical Excellence: Even though it's not visible, it's the technical stuff too that makes this game special. Drei is the first real-time multiplayer iPad game with advanced physics and 3D rendering, as far as we know, taking mobile gaming to the next level.

“Metro 2033: Wars” is a turn-based, open-world, strategy game, based on the story of Dmitry Glukhovsky's best-selling novel series, “Metro 2033.”

It’s the year 2033 and the entirety of the world has been reduced to nuclear rubble.  Humanity is nearing extinction and radiation is making even the most basic surface dwelling, uninhabitable.  New life forms have arisen that are far better adapted to this new dark, damp and alien-like world.  Bands of survivors live on without ever knowing the warmth of sunlight, and whether or not they are the last ones left on Earth.  The Moscow Metro is the reluctant home for this new humanity and one you protect at all costs.

Metro Stations have become city-states run by new and emerging Factions, uniting its members around ideas, religions, water, or simply the need to survive.  Your  daily existence centers around gathering resources necessary for survival, repelling attacks of mutants, exploring and conquering new metro stations and developing armed mercenary units when the need arises.  To survive, you'll have to build necessary facilities at Stations, establish diplomatic relations with your neighbors and uphold the economy of your little underground state.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

KEY FEATURES:
*  Classic Turn-based, highly strategic battles, with a wide variety of tactics and special attacks
*  Open World game play, with detailed, story-driven goals to guide you
*  189 metro stations that you can trade, battle or  inhabit, if you wish
*  25 types of mercenaries with individual combat abilities to construct battle-ready Squads
*  24 different Factions to either battle or establish diplomatic relations with
*  20 different building options to manage your resources and keep your clan alive
*  Pay ONCE!  Own it all!  No additional in app purchases.

Grim story, ambient soundtrack and the constant struggle for survival, will plunge you into the mysterious, post-apocalyptic atmosphere of “Metro 2033.”

ARP ODYSSEi	105809920	USD	29.99	1.0.3	4+	Music	25	5	2	1	"The legendary ARP sound, exquisitely reproduced in software.
ARP ODYSSEi - A mobile analog synthesizer for iOS.

The ARP Odyssey of 1972 has earned an unshakable position as a classic analog synthesizer. In 2015, KORG produced the ARP ODYSSEY, a complete reproduction of the original. The ARP genes that shook the worldwide music scene are being passed on, and its history continues.

The next platform for the ARP ODYSSEY is iOS. We want the unforgettable ARP sound to be easily available on a device that as many as possible of today's players can obtain; this resulted in the ""ARP ODYSSEi"" app for iPad / iPhone. Based on the revived ARP ODYSSEY, we used KORG's proprietary CMT circuit modeling technology to reproduce the analog feeling and sound of the original as closely as possible. We've also given it numerous enhancements that are possible only with software, such as long-awaited polyphony and built-in effects.

The real analog ARP ODYSSEY, and now the uniquely evolved ARP ODYSSEi, brings the universal fascination and inimitable sound to every device. 

* Due to differences in CPU speed of iPads / iPhones, iPad 3rd gen/2/iPad mini/iPhone 4s are not supported, only iPad Air/iPhone 5s or later is recommended.

[ Features ]

- Faithfully models the circuit of the ARP ODYSSEY: The circuitry has been reproduced using KORG's proprietary CMT (Component Modeling Technology), developed over the years starting with the KORG Legacy Collection.

- New functions to create all-new ARP sounds: Added a voice assign mode that allows you to play chords, an arpeggiator that can be programmed in detail like a step sequencer, and effects that can transform the sound in diverse ways.

- Get all three of the sought-after revisions: In addition to the standard design of the Rev3 with its black panel and orange silk-screening, you can optionally obtain the white-paneled Rev1 and the black-paneled gold silk-screened Rev2 designs, together with fifty new preset sounds that take advantage of the distinctive filters of those models.

- Produce music together with KORG Gadget: ARP ODYSSEi can be used in conjunction with the ""KORG Gadget"" music production DAW app that has won numerous awards around the world. If both apps are installed, it can be used as the ""Lexington"" gadget inside the KORG Gadget app.

Reviewed by WIRED, TechCrunch, Mashable, Forbes, Wall Street Journal, Popular Mechanics, The Independent, Macworld, and many, many others!

With VHS Camcorder, you'll make home movies that look and sound like video tapes pulled out of storage after 30 years. You can change the on-screen date to trick your friends, create flashing cheesy custom titles, mess up the picture by shaking your device and use the zoom lens feature to emphasize those truly embarrassing moments!

Here's Why You Need It:

“The scale of Til Morning's Light is bigger than just about anything else on a smartphone: not only is the world huge, but the dialogue is fully voice acted, and the graphics look fantastic.” – The Verge 

“Far and away, my favorite ride at any of Disney’s theme parks is The Haunted Mansion … To that end, I can offer no higher compliment to developer WayForward’s Til Morning’s Light than to say that, at its best, it feels like a private invitation to The Haunted Mansion from the ghost host himself.” - Gamezebo

Help her explore the huge, creepy, and not exactly empty mansion, revealing its darkest secrets and hopefully a way out. There are clues to decipher, tools to collect, and puzzles to solve. If all else fails, Erica can beat the goo out of supernatural nasties with an arsenal of clubs, knives, and swords. Oh, did we forget to tell you? Erica has to escape by dawn, or she’ll become the next ghost in the mansion! 

Brought to you by Amazon Game Studios and WayForward, developers of the Shantae series and DuckTales: Remastered,Til Morning's Light delivers a deep storyline and charming, quirky characters set in beautiful, haunting environments, with drama and surprises around every creepy corner.

As an audio prequel to the game, The Private Blog of Erica Page is available as a free audiobook on Audible. Download it today and listen to Erica’s blog posts made prior to her night trapped in the mansion. Narrated by Stephanie Sheh, the voice of Erica Page."	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	19	1696	0	1

Be honest, have you ever heard these complaints about healthy eating?

- “Eating healthy is too expensive!”
- “It takes too long! I don’t have hours to spend in the kitchen.”
- “Healthy food is too bland”
- “I just can’t afford to eat the food needed for bodybuilding”
- “I always end up cheating and slipping back in to bad habits”

Kevin Curry, founder of Fit Men Cook, has been there. After spotting a picture of himself on a friend’s Facebook wall he knew it was time for a change.

He followed all the common advice, changed to a healthy diet and started hitting the gym.

For a few months, things were great, but after a while he found himself craving the old foods he was trying so hard to avoid.

He got his hands on every book he could find on nutrition and started experimenting in the kitchen.

His aims were simple:

A) Food should be easy to prepare and affordable
B) Food should be vibrant and tasty, never boring
C) Preparing food in advance is important
D) Following a, b, c helps you achieve your fitness goals

Kevin shares his journey with the Fit Men Cook community and inside this brand new app where you’ll find the best way to prepare 273 of his most popular recipes.

Not only is Kevin a great host, who’ll fill you with inspiration for healthy meals, but he’ll also break down the steps in a way that’s easy to follow.

#3
FOCUS ON MEAL PREP

Buying ingredients in small quantities can make recipes more expensive. Not only that, but many of us don’t have the time each day to spend in the kitchen.

Meal prep is the solution. By designating two days of the week as your main cooking days, you can prepare your meals in bulk and eat healthy all week.

This is a crucial part of the app, and many of the meals are designed with meal preparation in mind, to make healthy living fit in with a busy life.

#4
MACRO COUNTING AND INTEGRATION WITH APPLE HEALTH APP

Bodybuilders and fat-loss superheroes can rejoice as the FitMenCook app has nutritional information built right in! Recipes list calories, protein, carbs and fat.

The app also includes a Meal Planner with sample weekly plans.

5#
SCALE UP A RECIPE

Increase the serving sizes by tapping the + and - buttons in the recipe view. You can also switch the measurements between metric and imperial.

There’s more including:
- Search by ingredient: Type in Egg Avocado to see all recipes containing these ingredients (By popular request from Kevin’s readers!)
- Share recipes with friends and family
- Available in English and Spanish

If you’d like to see a video demonstration by Kevin of the app in action, take a look at: http://fitmencook.com/app/

Proloquo2Go - Symbol-based AAC	723764224	USD	249.99	5.0.1	4+	Education	37	5	3	1	"Proloquo2Go is an award-winning symbol-supported communication app. It provides a voice to over 150,000 individuals who cannot speak. The app is designed to promote language development and grow communication skills. Its innovative features support users, parents, teachers and therapists to quickly personalize the vocabulary and settings.

“Users can open Proloquo2Go and begin to use it for effective communication immediately” – Susan Berkowitz, MS-SLP, AAC Consultant.

Proloquo2Go is used by people with autism, down syndrome, cerebral palsy and other diagnoses. It is available in English, Spanish and French, including regional and bilingual support. The app can be used on iPad, iPhone, iPod touch and Apple Watch.

Research-based
Did you know that 200 to 400 words account for 80% of what we say? And that most of these core words are not nouns but verbs, pronouns, prepositions, etc.? Proloquo2Go’s research-based Crescendo™ vocabulary puts core words front and center for easy access. Core words combined with AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) best practices can greatly improve the user’s language development and communication skills. And this is not only for trained therapists; parents, siblings, teachers, friends and peers can and should participate too! Find out more at bit.ly/core-words.

Growth of communication skills
Proloquo2Go is one of the few AAC apps that covers all users, from beginning to advanced communicators. Its research-based Crescendo™ vocabulary offers three levels: Basic Communication, Intermediate Core and Advanced Core. It's easy to switch levels within the same vocabulary while retaining your customizations. To make sure users reach their full potential, we recommend using a large grid size. With Progressive Language you can hide buttons showing only the most important ones, and reveal vocabulary in a developmental sequence as communication skills grow.

Language development
To support language development, we have created templates to keep core words on a consistent place throughout the vocabulary. This takes advantage of one of the ways we learn how to do things - motor planning. We have used these templates for the folders we created, but you can also use them to create folders yourself. In addition, Proloquo2Go offers full grammar support that is customizable to the user’s level.

Easy customization
We have pre-programmed Proloquo2Go with over 10,000 words, so you only need to do some fine-tuning to personalize the vocabulary. To add your own buttons you have access to more than 20,000 SymbolStix symbols or you can use your own photos. Quickly create new pages with our (activity) templates. Use the many accessibility settings like scanning for users with fine-motor challenges or Apple’s VoiceOver for users with vision impairments. Buttons, pages, navigation and access - it can all be customized with just a few taps.

Feature highlights
• Research-based vocabulary with three levels
• 23 pre-programmed grid sizes
• Core words located consistently throughout the vocabulary for motor planning
• Quick and easy customization
• Many accessibility features for users with fine-motor and visual impairments
• Customizable grammar support for verbs, nouns, pronouns and adjectives
• More than 60 natural-sounding free Text to Speech voices, including children’s voices

Support
We don’t leave you after purchase - our support team is available 7 days a week at support@assistiveware.com and always happy to help. To get started watch our free e-learning videos and have a look at our PDF tutorials. Our AssistiveWare Core Word Classroom provides you with resources for AAC implementation. You can also connect with peers on our closed Facebook groups.

POWER-UPS

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

* A NOTE ABOUT COMPATIBILITY WITH NON-iPHONE USERS:  Sharing images with Facebook, Twitter and Email works with pretty much anyone, but depending on what cell network and type of cell phone the person you're sending to has, some of the images you send via text messaging may not work.   This has nothing to do with CLIPish, but is a factor of the compatibility between: 1) the iPhone, 2) your network provider, 3) the other person's network provider, and 4) the other person's cell phone.  See http://clipish.net/support.

* FAST INTERNET CONNECTION RECOMMENDED:  Due to the server communication, CLIPish works best for users with a strong 3G signal or WiFi connection.

* FAMILIES:  This app accesses Internet content, but filters out adult material.  For the strongest protection, set your rating filter to Strict or get the Family Edition.

* ANIMATIONS ON FACEBOOK:  You can send all the items found in CLIPish to Facebook, HOWEVER, Facebook converts all animations to still images, as Facebook does not allow animations to ""play"" on their site.

* Some images featured are public domain.  If you believe your work has been included in err, please let us know so it can be removed immediately.

Electric RC Sim is a flight simulator for radio controlled aircraft. Fast startup plus realistic physics and graphics make it a pleasure to fly. Use it to learn to fly (I did!), hone your skills, or just have fun flying around.

Learning to fly an RC plane takes practice, and Electric RC Sim can help you learn much faster.  If (when) you crash, just press the reset button and you're flying again. There's no need to fuss with building, repairing, or waiting for a calm day, saving you time and money.

Includes:
 * two drones: simulates 4 motors, 3 axis gyro, PID controllers. Practice flips!
 * all my favourite aircraft: two trainers, a slow flyer, an aerobatic plane and a flying wing
 * aerobatic plane: learn to perform moves such as knife edging, snap rolls, ground loops
 * P-51 for some scale flying fun
 * ducted fan jet with massive control surfaces: crazy fast and crazy fun. Do flat spins like Maverick!
 * control line plane: great for learning control basics
 * ""antigravity"" trainer: have fun while learning the controls without having to worry about gravity
 * four different flying fields, each with different wind conditions
 * handy help guide for beginner pilots

Features:
 * detailed nonlinear nonstationary flight dynamics model
 * photorealistic graphics
 * intelligent camera view and zoom helps improve sense of space and speed of your plane
 * landscape and portrait view: portrait view helps with sense of altitude of your plane
 * works great on iPhone; looks amazing on iPad
 * realistic engine sounds: gotta love the sound of a screaming brushless!

Advanced controller (available as an optional In-App Purchase):
 * set rates, expo and trim per model
 * access to additional drone modes:
   - hold: gentler for beginners
   - expert: a blend of acro and auto levelling
   - acro: sticks control turn rates - flies just like a 3d heli!
To prevent accidental purchases, you can disable In-App Purchases in your device settings.

Customer reviews:
""I received a physical quad copter/drone as a gift, and having never been around one had issues flying it. I was hesitant to practice, fearing causing damage to the flyer or persons/animals. I found this app which allows simulated flying in a safe environment with the exact controls my particular model used. After a couple days with the app I was able to fly the real thing with confidence, and within a week was completing flips, spins, fast direction changes, and expert maneuvers. I can't recommend this program enough.""
""What a great training tool... Superb stall and flight control simulation. Love the wind...""
""Most realistic rc sim at the moment!! ... novice to experienced will enjoy""
""Portrait view is a great idea, and the camera zoom works perfectly. UI is simple and to the point...""
""Once I heard the word 'flips'... Awesome""

Check out ""Electric RC Sim Lite"" if you'd prefer to try before you buy. It features the 3 Channel trainer plane and one field.

King of Dragon Pass	364490752	USD	9.99	2.3.2	12+	Games	43	5	1	1	"Create your own epic saga of conflict, mythology, and community! This acclaimed game of magical storytelling blends interactive stories and resource management. It’s set in Glorantha (the world of the games HeroQuest, RuneQuest, and soon 13th Age). 

It’s immensely replayable, thanks to over 575 interactive scenes and two objectives. Short episodes and automatic saving mean you can play even when you only have a minute or two. The built-in saga writes down the story for you. And advisors with distinctive personalities help you track your cows.

The gorgeous hand-painted artwork won Best Visual Arts at the second Independent Games Festival.

• Everything in the game is utterly convincing and even years after release, the possibilities seem endless. (One of the 5 best strategy games ever made) [Rock, Paper, Shotgun]
• It's like they took the best parts of Civilization games and combined them with the best part of Choose Your Own Adventure style game books. … What I like most about King of Dragon Pass is the seemingly infinite possibilities that the game has. … I can't get enough of King of Dragon Pass. [Touch Arcade]
• A wholly unique adventure that has no equal on the iPhone. [Pocket Gamer]
• An interactive story with a level of complexity and brilliance that's rarely seen in video games. [Gamezebo]

Players say:
• I am really happy to have found this game. It scratches so many itches: simulator, rpg, adventure book...Great work! I find myself playing it on both my iPad and iPhone. Very addictive!
• I got this game at 6pm tonight. It's now 4am, and I've hardly scratched the surface of the depth of this game. 
• I now have a fun, engaging, thought provoking RPG on my iPhone, an RPG that fits in my purse and that I can play any time I want, not having to have my computer or Xbox 360 near me to do so. 
• If Bioware remade Civilization they'd be lucky to end up half as good as King of Dragon Pass.
• It's impossible to describe the emotional tug you feel when an old and trusted advisor, who you've watched grow from a young upstart, dies of old age. Or when an exploration team disappears into the wilds, never to be heard from again. Or when a cursed clansman, shunned by his peers, sacrifices himself to stop a raid. This game will never leave my iPhone. That's the only accolade possible.

The game is completely accessible via VoiceOver.

Kiwake Alarm Clock - Take back your mornings	57243648	USD	2.99	2.6.5	4+	Lifestyle	37	0	11	1	"Tired of oversleeping? If you really want to stop hitting the snooze button, then Kiwake is the best solution for you! This smart alarm is specifically designed to transform you into an early-bird, and it's actually easier than you think. You just didn't have the right tools before.

So, are you ready to become a morning bird?
 
Let’s face it: regular alarms don’t work very well. You just hit the snooze button as many times as you could, then rush for the rest of your morning trying not to be late. What you really need is a coach that will help you build a strong morning routine, and that’s exactly what Kiwake is designed for.  
 
Kiwake will drive you out of bed whether you want it or not! Like any good coach, it will give you a hard time if you don’t follow the rules, but also respect you when you actually do. The more you stick to your routine, the less annoying it becomes.

WHAT PEOPLE SAY
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
■ ""There's no better app out there that gets you out of bed as effectively as Kiwake."" by Juanbo
■ ""Love this app! I have a really hard time waking up in the morning and this has been very helpful."" by JMTartteacher
■ ""This app have changed my life. For the first time in my life I'm having time to eat breakfast in the morning since I'm not snoozing anymore. You are geniuses guys! Thank you! (Best spent money in my life.)"" by Deahtrams
 
HOW IT WORKS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Kiwake’s mission is to walk you through a brief but complete wake-up process to make sure that you are fully awake.
 
This process can be divided into three main categories you need to wake up every morning:
 
  1. Your Body, by standing up and leaving your bed.

  2. Your Brain, by stimulating it and keeping it away from excuses you could find to go back to sleep. 

  3. Your Motivation, by reading your goals to start your day inspired.
 
Kiwake will request a proof that you went through each of those categories:
 
■ Body wake-up: take a picture of an object far from your bed to prove you left it. This is an object that you already saved when you have set the alarm. You could take advantage of this by getting close to the shower or immediately starting your coffee maker.
 
■ Brain wake-up: complete a quick mini-game that requires your full attention. By focusing on the game, your brain will not be able to manipulate you with those famous excuses to go back to bed. You know, the ones like “Meh… a shower will only take me one minute” or “I can prepare and pack my lunch in 30 sec”.  
 
■ Motivation wake-up: read and check all your main goals, because there is no better way to jumpstart your day than giving yourself a motivation boost! 
 
FEATURES
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
◦ No snooze button : don't try to find one, there are none and it's better for you.
 
◦ Cooldown timer : not snoozing doesn't mean you have to instantly jump out of bed. Take some time to stretch first (3 min max)
 
◦ Intuitive, effective and easy to use interface. 
 
◦ Customizable settings : 
   - add multiple alarms, with the possibility to set specific days of the week.
   - choose between a variety of mini-games, their length and difficulty.

Initially released in Japan in 1993, Secret of Mana took the world by storm with its innovative real-time battle system and gorgeously rendered world. It continues to stand out among other action RPGs for its seamless gameplay that anyone from beginner to veteran can enjoy.
One of the most memorable elements of the Mana series is the Ring Command menu system. With the single press of a button, a ring-shaped menu appears on the screen, where players can use items, change weapons, and do a variety of other actions without needing to switch screens. This Ring Command menu system for which the Mana series is so well known was first introduced in Secret of Mana and has since appeared in most games in the series.
Play as Randi and his two companions, Primm and Popoi, as they adventure all around the world. At the center of our epic story is the mystical power of Mana. Battle the empire in its quest for control of Mana. Befriend the eight elementals who wield the forces of nature itself. Numerous encounters await at every turn.

1993年8月6日,《聖劍傳說2》在超級任天堂上發售,以當時的新概念系統“動作戰鬥”博得了相當的人氣。這是一款將指令戰鬥的戰略性融入到即時、無縫戰鬥中的角色扮演遊戲,無論新手還是老玩家都能從中體驗到充分的爽快感。

“指令環”是《聖劍》系列的特色系統之一。按鍵後畫面上會出現環形的選單,不需要切換畫面就可以使用道具、更換武器,是一種非常方便的系統。這一系統在《聖劍傳說2》裏首次登場,之後為整個系列所傳承。

玩家將操作主人公Randi,以及他的夥伴Primm和Popoi行動,隨著劇情的展開而前往世界各地冒險。本作劇情的關鍵,是肉眼無法看見的強大力量“瑪娜”。與覬覦瑪娜之力的帝國軍隊作戰、邂逅掌管自然之力的精靈們……在他們冒險的旅途中,將會有諸多有趣的故事在前方等待著。"	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	14	1556	0	1

Papa's Taco Mia HD	62189568	USD	2.99	1.0.0	4+	Games	24	5	1	1	"Have a flavor fiesta with seasonal tacos and daily specials in Papa's Taco Mia HD!

-- ABOUT THE GAME --

Hooray!! You've just won Papa Louie's taco-eating contest, so grab your spatula because you’re the proud owner of a brand new... JOB!?! You'll be busy in the taco shop as you unlock a wide array of ingredients for new seasonal tacos, and serve Special Recipes to your customers to earn a variety of big bonuses.

Each station in the taco shop is a hands-on process, and you'll have to multi-task between all of the different stations to keep up with your orders.  Add pans of meat to the stove, and keep checking back on each pan to flip and cut the meat at the correct times.  Pour meat into a variety of taco shells, and fill the tacos with piles of delicious toppings and sauces.  Finish off the meal with a basket of crispy chips and a bowl of fresh salsa, and serve the food to your hungry customers!

-- GAME FEATURES --

Get ready to build some tasty tacos unlike any you've made before!  As the seasons change outside the taco shop, your customers will order brand-new holiday tacos with a huge amount of new seasonal ingredients.  You'll unlock new taco shells, meats, toppings, and sauces for each holiday of the year, and your customers will love thinking outside the box and ordering a creative new take on tacos. 

Customers will occasionally bring you unique Special Recipes, which you can serve as the Daily Special in the taco shop!  Each Special also has a bonus you can earn for serving a prime example of that recipe.  When you serve enough Specials to master that recipe, you'll also earn a special prize!

Papa's collection of Stickers are now arriving on your tablet!  During the game, you'll be able to earn 90 colorful Stickers by completing a wide variety of tasks and achievements.  Each customer in your shop also has a list of their three favorite Stickers:  Earn all three of that customer's favorite stickers and you'll be rewarded with a brand-new outfit to give to that customer!

Play as Mitch or Maggie, or create your own custom character to work in the restaurant!  You can also hire or create a Server to help with your shop's Dining Room, where customers can sit and enjoy their freshly-made tacos.  Visit the Shop to find an extensive wardrobe of holiday clothing and accessories for your workers, which you can buy with your hard-earned tips.  Earn even more clothing and other prizes by playing Foodini's Mini-Games after each workday!

The customizable lobby is back, with new themes of furniture and decorations for each holiday of the year!  Decorate the restaurant with holiday decorations and your customers won't mind waiting even longer for their food.  You can also change the wallpaper, flooring, countertop, and trim, which will change the decor in the Dining Room as well!

*** Stunningly high-quality piano and a full range of keyboard sound engines ***
KORG Module has five dedicated sound engines, providing a number of high-quality sounds that can be played back on your iOS using the ""NATIVE ENGINE”. These engines feature technology that was developed for KORG's historic line of workstations and synthesizers including: Acoustic Piano, Electric Piano, Clav, Organ, and Multi. Each display has carefully selected parameters, making it convenient and easy to adjust the sounds. We’ve also carefully ensured ideal playability and designed the system for ultra-low latency.

Of course you can also use any MIDI keyboard that can connect to your iPad via Apple Lightning - USB camera adapter. The velocity curve function conforms the sound to your playing dynamics, so you'll be able to perform comfortably using any MIDI keyboard. Even if you don't have a MIDI keyboard, you can use the apps on-screen keyboard, phrase function, or MIDI player to play the sounds. The MIDI player can load and play standard MIDI files for your listening enjoyment.

Welcome to Toca Lab: Elements! Explore the colorful and electrifying world of science and meet all 118 of the elements from the periodic table. 

Discover elements by experimenting with the lab tools! 

* Take your element for a spin in the centrifuge.
* Warm them up in the Bunsen burner. 
* Put the element on ice with the cooling agent! 
* Add a drop or two of mysterious liquids from the test tubes.
* Change their voltage and make them magnetic with the oscilloscope.

Each element has it's own personality. In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? 

The time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!

Toca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science. While the periodic table in Toca Lab: Elements is accurate, the way new elements are created is not. Instead, it’s a fun way to experiment, discover and create curiosity in the world of science. Toca Lab: Elements is just a starting point for further exploration!

コンテンツについて

小学館「プログレッシブ ロシア語辞典」

ロシアの今を読み解く、最新ロシア語辞典

初学者から中・上級者まで使える本格的ロシア語辞典です。携帯できるコンパクトサイズに6万余語を収録。ロシアの新聞・雑誌を読むための最新語彙、政治・経済・社会・文化などの専門語、IT用語、俗語を積極的に採録、人名や国名・地名、略語も本編に収録しています。ロシアの地名は本辞典で初めて連邦管区を関連づけました。
不完了体と完了体がペアになる動詞については、常に不完了体動詞を見出しとし、完了体動詞をそのペアとしてまとめて記述しています。これにより不完了体か完了体かの区別が明快です。
初学者の学習のために、基本語にはカタカナ発音と英単語を併記し、用例や用法解説を充実させました。さらに、ロシア文字のイタリック体は初学者あるいはたまにしか辞書を引かない人にとってなじみにくいので、本辞典では成句表現などには斜体字を採用しています。
巻末にはとっさの必要にも応える1万項目の和露編を設けました。

• Use your banked coins to buy sillier suits and enhanced power ups
• Sumptuous 3D Graphics

• Regular updates

- Touch Arcade 5/5

“Sometimes a game catches you by surprise. Be it with its ingenuity, its style, or its sense of humor. Other times a game catches you with all three, like Human Resource Machine.”

Message from Michelle of Nom Nom Paleo:

Hey, Nomsters – my updated cookbook app is here, and it’s finally available for your iPhone!

This “cookbook on steroids” is a uniquely immersive culinary experience. It’s a visual feast packed with brand new recipes, as well as updated versions of classic Nom Nom Paleo dishes—all presented with my own special brand of whimsically snarky commentary. Food lovers and busy home cooks can visually follow each of my recipes from the pantry to the dining room table.
 
But that’s not all! For those who want to learn more about the “caveman” approach to nutrition and health, I’ve included a “Paleo 101” primer that explains why we eat whole, unprocessed, real foods (like meat, seafood, vegetables, fruits, and nuts) and avoid highly-processed and pro-inflammatory foods. You’ll also find an in-depth shopping guide, a 30-day meal planner, an interactive shopping list, and much, much more.
 
My hope is that this app will delight, engage, and inspire you to eat well and be well!

***** Children's Technology Review Editor's Choice *****

""This is a great way to let children informally and playfully discover some of the big ideas they’ll encounter later on in their school curriculum. Apps like this one are good reminders for why you spent hundreds of dollars on a phone or tablet for your child."" — Warren Buckleitner, editor, Children's Technology Review

Trigger earthquakes! Make volcanos erupt! Investigate plate tectonics, weathering, erosion, and deposition. Travel across time to see how our home has changed over eons, pre-Pangea to the present.

The Earth is an interactive model that lets kids study and observe the geological forces that change the planet—above and below the surface, in a matter of minutes and over millions of years. 

The Earth is No. 5 in Tinybop’s Explorer’s Library series, designed for curious kids ages 4+ to dive deep into big ideas. The apps in this series have won Best of the App Store, App Store Editors’ Choice, Parents’ Choice, and Children's Technology Review Editor’s Choice awards.

“Gorgeous visuals and a tense atmosphere make for a game that offers plenty of scares and will keep you hooked until the very end” – MacLife.com

“What Lost Within really thrives on is the ability to tell a compelling story in an easily-digestible way throughout the experience. In-between the jumps and frights I had a burning desire to unravel the game's various mysteries, and press on to the next area.” – Destructoid

“Lost Within is a survival horror meets adventure game, so it is kind of a little bit like what would happen if Silent Hill and Myst had a gruesome, gruesome baby together.” – Pocket Gamer

From the developer of Prey -- Survive a haunted asylum and its monstrous Inhabitants. Confront a legendary killer who prowls the abandoned wards. Scavenge and create makeshift weapons or conserve your resources and employ stealth tactics to sneak past the lurking horrors. When all else fails, run for your life or find a place to hide. To escape, you must uncover the asylum's dark mystery: the shattering secret that led to its condemnation. There are many doors, but there is only one way out."	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	11	1169	0	1

Bumble – Find a Date, Meet Friends & Network	91858944	USD	0.0	1.12.6	17+	Lifestyle	37	0	16	1	"THE BUZZ IS REAL
“A win-win for both genders.” - Inc.
“Bumble's found a way to weed out jerks online.” - Time 
“Bumble is redefining dating rules.” - Cosmopolitan
“Bumble is swiping the weirdness out of online dating.” - Fast Company

CHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME
Finding relationships online isn’t embarrassing anymore. Bumble has lifted the stigma of online dating by employing robust reporting and setting unprecedented standards for respectful behavior.

The app has also successfully shaken up traditional gender roles in heteronormative dating. On Bumble, ladies always talk first. Bumble is also the first of its kind to bring friend-finding to social networking. Now you can swipe through potential dates and friends on the same platform.

In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move and 24 hours to respond or the connection expires. Prompting conversation has lead Bumble to the highest post-match chat rate in the industry.

【玩家&媒体人评论】
[回合迷]：震撼爆屏的战斗画面，真实刺激的打击快感，让我又想起了热血的青春记忆。

[RPG爱好者]：出色的打击感、酷爽的PVP对决，让我体验到畅快格斗的乐趣。

[熊猫]：画面上的质量要比同类网游好的多，而音乐音效也有着非常出色的表现，游戏中的一大特色大概就是交互的体验，语聊、空间、温泉、跨服等玩法都极大地带动了游戏中人与人之间的交流，让交友的方式变得更加多样化。

[幺幺]：《修仙幻想》的音乐内容十分完善，在很多场景中，音乐都能非常切合的与游戏场景进行搭配，因为是回合制游戏，所以当玩家进入战斗画面时音乐的切换速度非常灵敏。游戏中非常之多的环境音效是另外一个亮点。

With Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any online video on your Chromecast (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Chromecast. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Chromecast immediately. Camera roll videos are also supported.

* The app only works with a Chromecast 1+2+Ultra by Google and on devices powered by Android TV.

* iTunes movies, Flash video and other DRM protected videos like HBO now are not supported!

* Please test your favorite videos with the free edition before upgrading!

* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). 

* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. 

* If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to chromecast@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.


>>> UPGRADE FEATURES (available as in-app purchases)

* Premium Edition: Unlocks all of the features listed here. Also future features are included, so you do not have to pay for them when they are released in an updated app version. 

* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.

* Local Videos: Cast your camera roll videos from an iPhone or iPad. Supports mp4, m4v and mov videos that were saved to the camera roll via Apples SD-Card/USB Adapter, iTunes Desktop Software or third party apps.

* Bookmarks: Add and manage as many bookmarks as you want, either in the bookmarks menu or directly in the browser.

* Remove Ads: Removes the sponsoring ads and gives the developers support for creating new features and updates. Please note: This upgrade will not block the ads that are part of websites that you visit. To remove website ads please purchase the additional Ad-Blocker upgrade.

* Ad-Blocker: Blocks ads & popups on most websites. You can enable/disable it at any time in the settings. Please note: To remove the sponsoring ads as well you need the additional Remove Ads upgrade. 

* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.

* Change Homepage: After purchasing this you can set your personal homepage in the settings.

ポケット戦国 -戦略と戦術で歴史を作れ！-【本格派 戦国シミュレーション】	150763520	USD	7.99	1.1.2	9+	Games	37	0	2	1	"■□■ 君のポケットに戦国時代をつめこもう！！ ■□■
スマホの中に広がる戦国の世界！街道を行き交う戦国の住民たち！全国に散らばる300の城と1000人を超える登場武将！究極のリアルタイム戦国シミュレーションゲームがiPhoneについに登場！！

▼ ポケット戦国とは！？

プレイヤーは戦国大名の1人になり、天下統一をめざします！まずは家臣団に命令して石高を増やし、商業を発展させましょう。城の防御力を高めたり、櫓や忍者屋敷などの施設を作ることも大切です。不要な敵を作らないように、外交を行うことも欠かせません。武将を雇い軍勢を整えたら、いよいよ隣国に攻め込んで下さい。同盟国の援軍があれば、勝利は確実です。合戦は400の兵隊が入り乱れる、白熱のリアルタイムバトル！用兵家としてのプレイヤーの戦術能力が、勝利の鍵となります！敵対する大名を武力制圧し、弱小大名は威圧して屈服させ、いくさ無き平和な世の実現を目指して下さい！！

シナリオは、桶狭間の戦いがあった1560年と、信長が苦境に立たされた1570年の、2本を用意！！

▼ 豊かな国を目指して！

プレイヤーが支配している城からは、農業収入と商業収入があります。収入額は人口や民の忠誠度、治安などに左右されます。「新田開発」や「商業投資」を行って土地を豊かにし、「施し」を行って民の心をつかんで下さい。民の忠誠度が下がると、一揆が発生して城を乗っ取ってしまいますのでご用心！「寺」を建設すれば、僧侶が近くの城の忠誠度を上昇させてくれるでしょう。いくさで治安が悪化すると、盗賊が発生して周囲の城の治安を悪化させますが、そんな時は「奉行所」を建設！お奉行様に盗賊をやっつけてもらいましょう。「大仏」を建設すれば、その城は参拝客が押し寄せる人気の観光スポットになるでしょう。金山がある城では採掘所を建設！強力な軍隊を養い、戦争を継続するには、しっかりとした経済力が不可欠です。豊かな国を目指しましょう！

▼ 巧みな外交を！

敵にしたくない大名へは親善使節を派遣して友好を保ちましょう。友好が高まれば同盟を結ぶことも可能です。同盟国は、自国が攻められた時に助けてくれる、とても頼りになる存在です。同盟国に、攻略目標の城への援軍を求めれば、勝利は間違いありません！でも、八方美人にはならないようにご用心。強力な大名が隣接している場合は、臣従して庇護を求めるのも良いでしょう。盟主となった大名はあれこれと出兵命令を出してきますが、コツコツと命令をこなせば恩賞を与えてくれます。逆に自国が強大な場合は、弱小大名を威圧して家臣にしましょう。従属大名に新たな城を与えるのも、逆に城を召し上げるのも、プレイヤーのお気に召すまま！お気に入りの大名に一国を与えるも良し！憎っくき大名を僻地の城に転封するのも良し！強者の理論をふりかざして、思う存分に楽しんで下さい！！

▼ 軍備を整えよう！

経済力が整えば、次に必要なのは軍備です。ポケット戦国では、大名も新参武将も、一人の武将が率いる兵は1000人。大軍を編成するには、それだけの武将を雇用する必要があります。部隊の兵科(兵の種類)には、「足軽」「侍」「鉄砲」「騎馬」の4種類があり、国ごとに兵の強さが異なります。たとえば信濃の騎馬や、三河の侍は強く、逆に尾張の兵は弱いことに定評があります。しかし心配ご無用！「道場」を建設したり、「訓練」を行ったりすることで兵隊の質は向上し、「政策」で兵隊の能力を高めることもできます。でも結局、戦いは数ですよ、お兄さん！

▼ 白熱のリアルタイムバトル！

合戦には最大で20人の武将、400の兵隊が参加します！忍者で敵の陣形を調べ、それに応じた適切な陣形を組んでください。合戦はリアルタイムに進行しますが、部隊へ命令する時には時間が止まりますので、ゆっくりと決断を下すことができます。合戦では、何よりも「士気」(兵隊の""やる気"")が重要です。士気が下がると兵の能力が落ち、ゼロになると逃げ出してしまいます。戦いで士気が下がった部隊は後方に下げて、適度に休憩を与えてください。部隊には兵科に応じて得意な能力があります。

・「足軽」は防御力に優れています。槍衾を並べて、戦線を維持するのがお得意です。でも、突破力がないのが悩みの種。
・「侍」は攻撃力に優れています。抜刀突撃で、敵の槍衾を突破するのだ！
・「鉄砲」は遠隔攻撃が可能です。どんな敵でも、命中すれば一発でやっつけます！でも防御力はとても低いので、敵が近づかないように気をつけてネ。
・「騎馬」の持ち味は、抜群の機動力！そして、すぐれた破壊力を持つ「突撃」です！敵の背後から突撃すれば、敵部隊を瞬殺するでしょう！足軽で敵部隊を防ぎつつ、背後からの騎馬突撃で敵を粉砕するのが勝利の黄金パターン！でも防御力が低いので持久力はありません。一撃離脱と側面攻撃こそが、騎馬隊の本領よぉぉー！

さあっ、用兵家としての君の手腕を存分に見せてくれっ！！

""5/5: Very compelling and rewarding."" - GameZebo

""4.5/5: if you're a fan of board games, you [...] owe it to yourself to pick this one up."" - TouchArcade
====================

In this universal adaptation of the popular board game (winner of a 2009 International Gamers Award, among others), you can compete with up to 5 people — or against a computer's AI — to construct buildings and ships to support your shipping empire. An in-depth tutorial and hint system help you develop the strategy you will need to dominate the harbor.

Collect resources to build and use new buildings, while paying your workers and saving up for ships. Buildings are a good investment, but ships provide necessary income. Deciding where to put your resources early on may determine your fate later in the game, so choose wisely!

With no setup time required, no pieces to lose, and no arguments about the rules, the future of board games is here and Le Havre gives you exactly what you want — to play!

5/5 “This is the best MMO and game ever. I have played other MMO games but this is the best one yet! You can battle other players and collect resources and build really cool buildings. If I had to rate this game it would be 10 stars. But, there is no 10 star rating.”

Tailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.

Whether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.

Need to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.

Once you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.

Make dolphins jump. Build a coral reef. Explore the deep sea. Create your own aquarium. These are just some of the fun things you can do with MarcoPolo Ocean, a “digital sandbox” for kids to play in that sparks their interest in the most unexplored part of our planet – the ocean.

Build and Explore
Six build-and-play activities bring the language and the images of the ocean to life. Ocean is playfully narrated and animated to reinforce vocabulary, physical attributes and ocean concepts.

*Coral Reef
*Octopuses
*Marine Mammals
*Fish
*Boat
*Submersible

Free Play Exploration
The open ocean is a personal aquarium your child can explore however he or she chooses!

*Explore from the shoreline all the way down to the sea floor
*Steer your submersible and boat through ocean waters
*Add marine animals and fish to the ocean and interact with more than 30 different species
*Investigate by tapping, dragging and swiping where the animals live in the ocean to see their natural behaviors and how they interact with other animals

Through self-directed discovery, we expose kids to early skills in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), focusing on the following concepts:

*The wide variety of animal species that live in the shallow and deep parts of the ocean
*Ocean landscape
*Construction and characteristics of a boat (shipping vessel) and submersible
*Characteristics of fish and marine mammals
*Topic-specific vocabulary exposure and acquisition

Privacy Policy
We take privacy very seriously. We do not collect or share personal information about you or your child, nor do we allow any third-party advertising. You can see our full policy at http://www.gomarcopolo.com/privacy-policy/

Bloxels: Build, Play & Share Your Own Video Games	255226880	USD	0.0	1.4.8	4+	Education	37	5	1	1	"Bloxels is a hands-on platform to build, play and share your own video games!

Take advantage of exclusive features including the new “Brainboards” with the Bloxels Video Game Builder Starter Kit, available at www.bloxelsbuilder.com and at major retailers starting October 1st!

OVERVIEW 

Build your own video games with Bloxels! The innovative video game creation platform makes concepting and execution easy. Watch your game world come to life as you create and animate play spaces, characters and objects because you are the artist, game designer, storyteller, programmer, publisher AND player! 

HOW TO BUILD GAMES WITH BLOXELS

The physical pieces in the Bloxels game set work with this Bloxels Builder app to digitize your creations, put them on-screen and make them playable. Use the 13 x 13 Gameboard and colored blocks to design a room, create the art for game elements and bring your heroes and villains to life. 

When creating game rooms, each color in your design represents a different element, like terrain, water or a hazard.  When building art, the blocks represent the pixelated image. Once you have finished adding blocks, snap a picture with the “in-app camera” to digitize your creation. Go from blocks to “bloxels” instantly! 

When your game is ready to share, post it to the Bloxels Infinity Wall (Players must have a Bloxels account to access the Infinity Wall features – Parental consent required). The community of 13-bit builders can explore each other’s gaming worlds, playing games and sharing elements. Game developers earn coins when others play their games. They can then use the coins to buy content from other games -- you decide which content is shareable. The elements can then be customized to fix and mix into the buyer’s game. Let your game evolve, create new games and see your imagination come to life!

NOTE: The Bloxels Gameboard is not required, however some advanced features require the Bloxels Video Game Builder Starter Kit, available at bloxelsbuilder.com and at major retailers.

【剧情】
这里是三丁目的街角。时间是正当昭和的年代。
正要开办奥林匹克而活力十足的城镇。
在这样的东京的一角、有着一间小小的杂货店静静的耸立在那而。
一位温和的婆婆、独自一个人经营的一家小小的店面。
挑望着被夕阳照的通红的东京铁塔、婆婆总是会回忆着过去的每一天。
曾经幸福的那一天、难过的那一天、发生了很多事的日子、以及那一天。
来吧、就让我们和婆婆一起、回到那一天那一个时候感受那一种感觉吧。
夕阳的红云和屋台叫卖的声音。
打弹珠、玻璃球、纸气球。
糖果、醋酸海带、万花筒。
一切的一切都有如宝石一般珍贵的每一天。
虽然是个没有手机也没有网络的年代、但所有事物都绽放着光彩…。
曾真心希望永远也别结束，那夏天的某一天…。
这是一个、随处可以遇到的、随处可见的、一位「婆婆」的故事。
◎玩法
【目的】
・从客人那里获得金钱后可以让杂货店提升等级！
・图鉴将会逐渐的被那些令人怀念的道具给填满，目标是全部收齐，加油！
・然后欣赏故事的结局吧！
・利用转蛋的硬币来将转蛋的整个系列都收归己有吧！
【基本规则】
(1) 利用「进货」来增加商品
(2) 身上握着大把零用钱的小鬼们（客人们）就会不断的涌进来
(3) 用手指画过客人的身体来让他付钱！
(4) 当金钱增加了之后就可以在「店铺」选单里选择强化店铺喔！
(5) 当店铺被强化了以后就会出现新的「进货」的种类
(6) 利用新的「进货」就可以更容易招来新的客人
(7) 收集了各式各样大量的客人之后图鉴里面的道具也会跟着逐一出现！
不断的重复(1)到(4)的动作之后金钱赚取的速度就会逐渐提升。
就这样一路努力不懈的将图鉴全数收齐并且看完所有的剧情故事吧。
【关于日期】
在游戏之中、日期会从星期一到星期日为一个循环一直不断的变化。
每一天会出现的客人都会稍微有点不一样。
哪一个客人会在星期几出现的部分可以在「图鉴」选单里面进行确认。
星期几是依照时间变化会逐渐改变的、所以偶尔开启游戏确认一下日期吧。
另外、提醒您星期几并不是依据真实时间而变化的。
【回忆】
在店铺的里面有一间婆婆的房间、这里有时会出现「回忆」漂浮在空中的情况。
只要收集这个、故事就会慢慢的往前进。
所以请别忘了偶尔也要去客厅里面晃晃喔。
【转蛋】
一起来旋转扭蛋、收集那些无聊透顶的小玩意儿吧。
转蛋的转出物会依照星期几而有所不同喔。
虽然有时候也会转到一模一样东西的时候、不过请不要灰心！
转蛋并不是使用金钱而是使用专用的「转蛋的硬币」来进行的。
转蛋的硬币可以透过收集「回忆」、或是偶尔在其它各种地方获得喔。"	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	21	1442	0	1

By using the dialogue exercises, you'll be able to improve both your Spanish comprehension and your speaking skills at the same time.

Be sure to check out the video demo on http://mosalingua.com

MosaLingua was designed by a Spanish professor and a team of polyglots who actually use MosaLingua on a daily basis.

Did you know that you can get by just fine on vacation knowing less than 500 carefully-chosen words?  Spending just 5 minutes per day for two months will allow you to memorize 600 words and key phrases!

Learn the essential 20% that will apply 80% of the time. Afterwards you can choose an area of focus that is relevant for you (travel, sports, business, technology...). 
Whether you are starting Spanish from scratch or you already know the basics, MosaLingua is adapted to suit your language needs. It's like having your own private tutor in your pocket!

Whether your motivation for learning Spanish is for school (diploma, class, course, SAT, GCSE), vacation, business purposes or simply for the joy of learning, MosaLingua will have you speaking Spanish in no time:

MOSALINGUA CONSISTS OF:
- 3000+ flash cards of vocabulary and phrases, including audio pronunciations by native Spanish speakers

- Learn only the most useful phrases for your studies, for your travel, or for Spanish SAT or Spanish GCSE

HIGHLY EFFICIENT AND PROVEN LEARNING METHOD:
MosaLingua uses the Spaced Repetition System (SRS), the product of several years of scientific research
- Calculates review dates for the flash cards according to how difficult you find each one, to encourage efficient and long term memorization

- You'll be amazed at how quickly you will learn new Spanish words and how addictive it becomes

Philm also features 500+ tracking stickers, meaning that stickers you add to a photo or video will track the subject. So if you put a heart sticker to your dog's head in a video of them running around, the app will target your dog and the sticker will follow them.

The 1991 revision of the Psalter, the work of thirty revisers and six editors, was further revised by seven revisers and two editors between 2009 and 2010.

! OH Fantastic Free Kick + Kick Wall Challenge	162557952	USD	0.0	4.0	4+	Games	40	5	2	1	"A new kind of free kick soccer game is here! Astonishingly real and definitely not like the other ones.
Use your finger and your brains to score awesome goals in crazy situations.

Controls are dead simple, but the game is intricate and addictive.
Will you be able to master the curved kicks??

【How to play】
・Touch and swipe (flick) the ball to shoot
・The direction of the swipe determines the direction of the ball
・The position (height) at which you release the finger determines the height of the ball
・The speed of the swipe determines the speed of the ball
・To do a curved kick, touch and swipe the ball on one of its sides
・If you touch the ball on its right side, its trajectory will bend to the left and vice versa
・The more the point at which you touch the ball is far from its center, the tighter will the curve be
・The slower the shoot, the tighter the curve, but if the curve is too tight the ball will not go very far
・Swiping making a curve will not have any effect on the curvature of the trajectory of the ball
・If you touch and swipe the ball on its top, it will describe a falling trajectory

Using a combination of these controls, you can achieve loop shoots or falling curved kicks.
Swiping gently and making the ball roll to the goal might even become a technique which needs to be mastered.


There are 80 stages
Take up the challenge and try to clear the whole 80 stages!

Civil War: 1861	203193344	USD	1.99	1.1	12+	Games	37	5	0	1	"Civil War: 1861 covers the opening battles of the American Civil War.  The game covers both the small and large actions of that momentous year, starting with the battle at 'Big Bethel', on to the comparatively vast engagements at 'Bull Run' and 'Wilson's Creek'.

In 1861 both sides have plenty of volunteer recruits who, though enthusiastic, lack battlefield experience.  On the weaponry side much of the equipment still belongs to the Napoleonic Era with a plethora of muzzle loading, smoothbore artillery.

Many of the commanders, who most would identify as the leaders the civil war armies, are still junior officers in the engagements recreated in this game.  Command the Union or Confederate forces in these key battles.

Neon Drive - '80s style arcade game	194145280	USD	3.99	1.24	4+	Games	38	5	9	1	"***WARNING: DUE TO AWESOME GRAPHICS, NEON DRIVE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH IPAD 1, IPHONE 4 (& OLDER IPHONES) OR IPOD TOUCH 4TH GEN (& OLDER IPODS)***

Neon Drive is a slick retro-futuristic obstacle-dodging game that will make your brain melt. You've been warned.

From beautiful cityscapes and ocean roads to exploding enemy spaceships, Neon Drive has it all. It's inspired by the arcade games of the 80's, but set against a futuristic backdrop of glowing cyber-grid, all in silky-smooth retina graphics. Neon Drive brings you 7 amazing levels, adding up to hours of enjoyment. Each level features multiple twists and perspective changes, keeping you on your toes (err, wheels) throughout the gameplay.

Neon Drive will put your mad dodging skills to a real test, mercilessly pushing the limits of your reaction time and short-term memory to avoid obstacles and dead-ends. Seriously, this game is wicked; just when you think you've got the hang of it, it turns the table on you.

Each level of the game comes with a custom-made retro music track, perfectly tuned and in sync with the roadblocks and your enemies. This allows you to just tap the beat, unplug, and zen out. Watch the landscape seamlessly morph from one scene to the next, in a ballet of colors and shapes, and let your inner driver take the wheel. You've got this.

Features:
 * 7 levels, hundreds of obstacles, and infinite challenge
 * Breathtakingly beautiful and silky-smooth retina graphics
 * Custom-made retro synth music, perfectly in sync with the obstacles
 * Super addictive (Neon Drivers Anonymous support group available upon request ;-))
 * Includes exploding enemy spaceships, seriously!
 * If you can finish all 7 levels, we hereby certify you have superhuman abilities!"	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	35	1749	0	0

First Year Demons	68433920	USD	1.99	1.0.0	9+	Games	38	4	1	1	"For generations, your family has kept China safe from chaos demons. Now you must uphold that duty while you're at university--just don't tell your roommates!

""First Year Demons"" is an interactive fantasy novel by Rebecca Slitt, author of ""Psy High."" Your choices control the story.  It's two games in one: a 30,000-word educational game, and a 43,000-word version of the same story that's just for fun. Both games are entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.

As the youngest member of a family with a secret and ancient duty to keep China safe from demons, you must balance your relatives' traditional values and expectations with the challenges of your first year at college and your secret study of potions, sword, and spells.

Between dorm­room parties and chemistry study sessions, you'll experience battle and betrayal. You'll learn just how important it is to stay close to your family--your life may depend on it! You'll see how China is changing: maybe it's better to offer your ancestors a smartphone than to slay a demon in their memory. And above all, you must not let your friends know why you really sneak out of your dorm so late at night! Demons are all around you, and you never know what might be hiding behind a friendly face.

• Battle chaos demons!
• Play as male or female, gay, straight or bi
• Hit the books, or go out and party!
• Stay close to your family ­ or turn against them and be cast out
• Specialize in swords, magic, or potions"	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	17	1541	0	1

Glass Road	434425856	USD	3.99	2.0.0	4+	Games	38	5	1	1	"Glass Road is the official digital version of Uwe Rosenberg's Glass Road board game. 

STORY: The Glass Road is a 150-mile long path through the Bavarian Forest near the border to the Czech Republic in Germany which was one of the biggest center of Glassworks and Brickworks in the 18th century and now you can become part of this world in this game.

== THE GAME == 
In Glass Road, you will produce glass and bricks and collect wood, clay and many other resources to build buildings and create your own landscape. 
To accomplish this task, you will need the help of a variety of specialists. You have to choose 5 of them in every round but when choosing your specialists, try to anticipate which ones your opponents will choose to use your own more effectively. So carefully choose cards that you think no other player will choose to use them more effectively, but also choose some that you think will be played by other players to benefit from that as well.

== PEOPLE ==
What people said about the board game:

""This game is amazing! How much depth and how much consciousness there is, tide in such a small, tiny, fast, elegant game!"" /Rahdo/

""Glass Road is a very deep and engaging euro that offers you a wealth of deep strategic and tactical choices and very little luck in a very short and elegant design. I would go as far as saying that there is no other game that I have played that achieves these levels of depth in that short of a playing time."" /F. Liouville - BGG/

""I started to play more and more and I realized all the subversive strategies in this game!...
....In fact, from the Solo experience I really do enjoyed this game!"" /Tox - Crits Happen/

""If you’re a fan of Uwe Rosenberg’s other titles, get this game. If you like having many – almost too many – strategic choices to make in each turn, get this game. If the production wheel concept intrigues you, get this game. In short, if you want a good, fun, medium-weight Euro-style game add Glass Road to your collection."" /Walt Mueller - boardgamequest/

 • “Wow - I'm just blown away by how good this is! The stream is awesome, and the breaking news is dead on. So much better than trying to follow multiple teams on ESPN. NICE JOB FELLAS!” 

 • “SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!! - As soon as I got the app and added my local team, I got breaking news from my team before they broke the news on a local sports talk radio that I listen at work every day. From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” 

 • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.”

 • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” 

 • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”

You have never played a game like this before! Get 'Em is fully indie-made, and will feature many different styles of gameplay, which will definitely tailor to everyone. Have you ever wanted to be an animal, in a big city? Have you ever wanted the ability to play a 3D cartoon or comic book like a video game?

If you love challenging games, dogs, action, adventure, and crime fighting, Get 'Em is for you!

**** NOTE FROM THE CREATOR ****
When I made this game, I wanted to create a game that all ages could play. Something that would be fun and cool for everyone. I wanted to eliminate blood and gore, heavy violence, and release something that was positive and up lifting. There are enough violent games out there. It was time for a new type of game that simply doesn't exist. However, this game does have very minimal cartoon/fantasy violence towards dogs and humans, but it's for a specific reason. I wanted to show and highlight what an actual crime-fighting K9 could endure. The game was never made with the intention to glamorize harming dogs as ""cool"" or ""fun"". The only intention of this game is to provide the world with something new, fun, and creative. I'm happy and proud to release this game to the world, and I hope you all will enjoy it! Your initial download will come with 8 out of the 10 levels of the game. I thank you in advance for your download, and I look forward to bringing you more amazing content soon!"	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	7	2712	1	1

________________________________________________
The walking dead have taken over the world. Mad scientists create horrible monsters in their secret labs. Marauders and ex-soldiers fight among the ruins of desolate cities. And the rest of humanity is simply struggling to survive.

Zombie Town Story is full of adventures in a world ravaged by the zombie apocalypse. Each of the game's episodes tells its own story. The direction of the plot depends on the decisions you make along the way. Do you help the little girl and her kitten in trouble, or do you just walk past? What do you give the robber? Do you shoot a friend infected by the zombie virus or not?

What is Zombie Town Story? It’s hundreds of puzzle levels where you find food and supplies to help you survive. It's dozens of weapon types, from chainsaws to sniper rifles, to use in your fight against the undead and mutants. And it's long hours spent unraveling the dark secrets of the world of the walking dead.

Game Features

- Your decisions determine the direction of the plot
- Earn supplies and equipment in puzzle levels
- Choose your weapon to fight the undead
- Solve the mystery of the zombie virus

In a world where “individuality” is destroyed, the only surviving life form are GUNTAI: the swarming body.
Storming through cycles of death and resurgence, GUNTAI speeds forward on the vast wastelands.

1. New Interactive Experience of driving the Swarming Body

You will be guiding a swarming body called GUNTAI, a flock made of as many as 500 birds.
Enjoy the dynamic sensation of precisely simulated swarm behavior by driving GUNTAI to fly through the field. A single mistake can kill over 100 birds, while many more might join in the next moment. Through cycles of death and resurgence, GUNTAI pushes forward with incredible speed.

2. Simple and Profound Game Element

The rules of the game are simple. The goal is to drive GUNTAI as far as possible within a given timeframe.
The speed and size of the swarming body increase as you pick up other birds resting on the ground. The larger the flock, the faster and farther it can travel. You can tighten the flock formation and increase speed by tapping the screen to activate the booster item. The timing to use this item can greatly influence your performance.

3. Infinite Space and Music That Continually Evolve in Real Time

The space and obstacles through which GUNTAI travels are generated dynamically in infinite variations,
renewing the sense of thrill and excitement in each session.
The mood is further amplified by real time generated music that responds to the formation of the flock. Wear headphones and raise volume for the most thrilling experience!

Real Pool 3D is one of the most realistic and enjoyable pool games available on mobile.

It features many pool game modes like 8 Ball, 9 Ball, UK 8 Ball, Time Trial, Matrix Mode and Practice Mode. So if you're a billiards fan, there is something for you to play in Real Pool 3D.

Customise your pool table by choosing the color and cloth patterns you like.

In Time Trial you have a time limit of 4 minutes, in which you have to pocket balls as fast as you can to achieve more score. When you pocket more than one ball back to back, your multiplier will increase and which will boost your score and time.

In Matrix Mode, when you pocket a ball your score will be multiplied by the difference of your previous and current ball number if the current is more than the previous; but if the current is less, then your score is divided by the current ball number. So be careful.

Have you ever thought about playing billiards on a real table, Real Pool 3D is the perfect way to try a variety of games. Real life graphics and angles to help improve your skills. Play Practice mode if you just want to relax and play without any rules.

REALISTIC PHYSICS
Real-time 3D physics simulation, authentically recreating the behavior of a real wooden Jenga tower. Each block is realistically affected by the surrounding blocks, recreating the same strategic depth as the original game.

TOUCH CONTROL
Anyone who’s played Jenga knows how delicate your touch needs to be. The iPhone’s super-accurate touch screen gives you the control you’ll need to go for world record heights (incidentally… the record is 40 2/3 layers!). Blocks can be teased out using a mix of gentle tapping and drag controls. It’s easy to begin with, but you’ll soon find it tough when the pressure is on and the tower is wobbling!

GYROSCOPE INTEGRATION
View the tower just as you would in real life by moving the device around it. The built-in gyroscopic mechanisms allow for unprecedented control of your viewpoint. Study the structure of the blocks to plan your next move.

SOCIAL GAMEPLAY
Obviously the best part of Jenga is putting off your friends as they are making their move. The four-player Pass’n’Play mode truly reproduces the nail-biting tension of the real thing… but you can play it anywhere!
And what’s more, Jenga for iPhone lets you compare your current tower height against that of friends around the world – while you play! A little friendly competition is the best motivator...

ARCADE MODE
Jenga on iPhone introduces a brand new mode: Jenga Arcade. Match colors for extra points and score multipliers by moving fast – but don’t topple the tower! While you play, you earn coins which you can spend on special boosts like collapse reverse, multipliers, and wildcards. It’s fast and frantic… totally turning Jenga on its head.

STUNNING VISUALS
Jenga for iPhone is beautiful. With full Retina display support, you won’t see a single pixel. Advanced wood shaders make the tower pop out and let you gauge its stability. And everything is set in beautiful environments, rivalling the quality of modern games consoles.

GAME CENTER INTEGRATION
Like all titles from NaturalMotion Games, Jenga fully supports Apple’s Game Center including leaderboards, achievements and easy friend comparisons.

AUTHENTICITY
Designed in consultation with Leslie Scott, the inventor of Jenga, to create the most authentic Jenga experience ever.

KORG iDS-10	88055808	USD	19.99	2.1.1	4+	Music	37	5	2	1	"The latest title in the KORG DS-10 series, now available for the iOS!

The KORG DS-10 series was an enormous hit for the Nintendo DS. Now, seven years later, it has undergone a further evolution while staying true to its original spirit. Now available is the KORG iDS-10, a portable synthesizer studio for iOS. 

The KORG iDS-10 combines a cutting-edge analog synthesizer, voice synthesizer, and analog drum machine inspired by motifs from the original KORG DS-10. This iOS app gives you a hand-held system to easily create electronic music, which requires persuasive sound with a minimal number of notes.

*** Powerful analog synthesizer lets you visually learn sound design ***
The analog synthesizer provides carefully selected parameters, making it easy to enjoy sound design. The unique patching function also lets you create sound in even deeper ways. Since all parameters can be automated, you have a wide range of song-production possibilities. Each synthesizer provides five types of effect with an oscilloscope that helps you see the sound. This cutting-edge synth engine takes full advantage of the iOS device’s CPU to generate astonishing sound, and will heighten your enjoyment using the KORG DS-10.

*** Enter your lyrics, and the voice synthesizer turns them into a voice ***
The voice synthesizer is one of the popular features of the KORG iDS-10. Based on a vocoder, its engine makes it easy to generate voices. It also supports input via a microphone which can be used as a conventional vocoder. The parameters are optimized for creating such voices, so you’ll be able to enjoy sound design with a different character than an analog synthesizer, further widening the possibilities for your music.

*** Analog drum synthesizer makes it easy to produce the sounds that you want ***
Drums are now more important than ever, and the iDS-10 provides an analog drum machine that’s carefully tuned for easy creation of powerful sounds. With total control over six drum sounds (kick, snare, hihat1 / ihat2, tom, and percussion), you can create awesome tracks with high impact.

*** Smart keyboard and KAOSS mode make step-recording enjoyable ***
The smart keyboard lets you specify a scale so that you can step-record without worrying about “wrong” notes. And of course there’s also KAOSS mode, where you can produce a limitless range of great-sounding phrases, with just a touch of the keyboard. The scale setting is also applied to the sequencer’s note display, so you can enjoy producing songs whether or not you have any musical knowledge or experience.

*** Pattern play that you can perform in real time ***
The pattern play capability of the KORG DS10 has further evolved, generating amazing user performances. You can seamlessly play 32 patterns, and also manipulate track mute and solo settings in real time. It’s guaranteed to result in the kind of protean acts that are notable in modern day DJ performances.

*** Send your songs by email for collaborative music productions ***
There’s a function that allows the transfer of song data via email, making it easy to exchange songs with your friends.

*** Mystery bingo!? ***
And then there’s the enigmatic mystery bingo; as you continue enjoying the KORG iDS-10, the full picture will become clearer …

This app was produced in cooperation with the game music and app production company “Detune.” Don’t miss this opportunity to experience the world of the KORG iDS-10 that resulted from this collaboration with Detune Inc.

The first title in the KORG DS-10 series was the KORG DS-10 which was announced in 2008. The second title was the KORG DS-10 PLUS which launched in 2009.
These are products of Marvelous Inc. For more details, refer to the following pages of that company’s website:

En cessant progressivement de vous laisser envahir et déborder par vos pensées et vos émotions, en choisissant d’agir plutôt que de réagir, et en apprenant à vivre au présent. 
La méditation de pleine conscience peut se pratiquer partout : au travail, chez soi, dans les transports en commun, en marchant, sur un banc dans un parc… 
De précieuses minutes de détente pour clarifier son esprit, prendre de la distance et apprendre à savourer plus intensément les bons moments
« Cette pratique très simple et qui ne demande qu'un peu de persévérance, explique Christophe André, peut modifier profondément notre rapport au monde, apaiser nos souffrances et majorer nos joies. »

CHRISTOPHE ANDRE, LE GRAND SPECIALISTE FRANCAIS DE LA MEDITATION DE PLEINE CONSCIENCE
Co-auteur de l'application, et guide des méditations, Christophe André est médecin psychiatre dans le service hospitalo-universitaire de l’hôpital Sainte-Anne, à Paris. Il a été l’un des premiers en France à proposer, dès 2004, la méditation à ses patients. Son ouvrage de référence sur le thème : Méditer jour après jour (L’Iconoclaste).
Il est l'auteur de plusieurs best-sellers sur le sujet.
Sur cette application, il a travaillé en collaboration avec Flavia Mazelin Salvi, journaliste à Psychologies magazine et Patricia Salmon Tirard, rédactrice en chef adjointe du magazine.

The app also delivers the full experience of using a film camera from shooting pictures to printing photos. Also, feelca adds more sense of the depths to your photos. Your films are organized and you can add short titles or captions to your polaroid-like photos for easy sharing with your friends.

'Feelca B' does not include complicated operations such as editing and post-correction. By tilting the Manual Focus Dial, capture the subject and space which differs according to light. You might lose focus or the photo might shake, but there is a beauty in themselves.

Like the past film cameras, taking careful look at the surroundings and taking each shots carefully would bring you the special experiences and sensational outcomes.

Onion Browser is the original open-source Tor-powered browser for iOS. Onion Browser helps you bypass censorship and access the internet with more safety and privacy.

You can read more about Onion Browser on the official Tor Project Blog: https://blog.torproject.org/node/1255

“The best Tor-related offering on iOS right now is Onion Browser” - The Daily Dot, October 14, 2015.

Featured in: The New York Times, The Guardian, Salon, TechCrunch, Gizmodo, Boing Boing, Lifehacker, Macworld, The Daily Dot, & others.

FEATURES:
• Browse the internet over Tor:
- Websites do not see your real IP address.
- ISPs and insecure wireless networks cannot track your browsing.
- Access .onion sites that are only accessible over Tor.

• Defeat internet filters and censors with ""obfs4"" & ""meek"" traffic masking.

• Fight online tracking: use a new IP address and clear your cookies/history/cache in one button.

• And more privacy-enhancing features!

DISCLAIMERS:
Web browsing is much slower than through a normal web browser or a VPN because your traffic is encrypted and relayed through the Tor network.

Multimedia often bypass Tor and compromise your privacy; video files and video streams are blocked by default and are not supported by Onion Browser.

Onion Browser might not work when inside countries or using ISPs that actively block Tor. If the app does not connect, try using bridges or visit the Help/Support page to see what you can do. Onion Browser does not carry any guarantee of successful use.

Use of Onion Browser is at your own risk; remember that sensitive data does not always belong on a mobile device.

Onion Browser is free and open-source software. You can read more about Onion Browser and how to support development of Tor on iOS by visiting onionbrowser.com"	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	47	1791	0	0

FreeSpeech - Build Language and Learn Grammar	197273600	USD	9.99	1.4	4+	Education	37	5	2	1	"*** FEATURED BY APPLE - #1 BEST NEW APP! ***

FreeSpeech is an app to learn the English language! Drag and rearrange picture tiles, and FreeSpeech will convert them into a perfectly grammatical English sentence. 
Explore how tenses, sentence forms, parts of speech, and other grammatical properties change the structure of English -- and it's all visual! 

FreeSpeech is the perfect app for anyone who is learning the English language - whether you are 
- Learning English from a second language
- introducing someone to English grammar
- Teaching children English

Developed by an interdisciplinary team including SLPs, educators, and researchers with over 100 years of collective experience, FreeSpeech is the most advanced language learning technology currently available. The technology behind FreeSpeech was the subject of a TED talk by its creator Ajit Narayanan which has been viewed more than one million times. The development of FreeSpeech, combining engineering with generative linguistics, earned the team recognition as one of the world's Top 35 Innovators from MIT Technology Review. AS SEEN ON TED BY 1M+ VIEWERS: http://go.ted.com/CW6u

""A powerful new app designed to help children of all learning levels and language abilities develop grammatically correct sentences... A welcome addition for anyone with young writers that struggle with arranging sentences or who have a language impairment that makes it frustrating to communicate."" 
- SmartAppsForKids

FreeSpeech is unique because it's the only app in the world that predicts grammar. You can throw a bunch of picture tiles at it, and the app will automatically figure out a grammatically correct sentence from them. 
- It's possible to manipulate words, tenses and structure as if you were manipulating building blocks.
- The app lets teachers and learners model/recast/contrast various grammar rules pictorially, all the while speaking out correct English. 

FreeSpeech is based on solid research, and builds language by:
- EXPANDING: Prompting users with questions to expand their sentences; 
- SCAFFOLDING: Intelligently predicting words that they are likely to use; 
- CONTRASTING: Visually modeling tense and sentence modifiers; 
- RECASTING: Automatically inserting prepositions and articles as needed; and
- ERRORLESS MODELING: Automatically predicting grammar, to assemble a map of pictures into a grammatically correct English sentence.

FreeSpeech features more than 2,000 symbols from Symbolstix, and is ideally suited to use alongside other AAC, articulation and education apps that use these lovely symbols.

The missing scientists, known as the Omicron Initiative, are responsible for developing new technologies.  The only clue to their disappearance is a mysterious text message reading ""we were forced to do it"".  The team's disappearance threatens the secrecy of it's research, which could potentially put your country into a chaotic panic.  Now there's only one person who can rescue the Omicron Initiative and protect its secret technology from falling into the wrong hands.

It's time to arm up and get in the war!


Behind the Game:

Hello, my name is James, I'm an indie developer and programmed 100% of Machines at War 3 over the last two and a half years!  It was quite the undertaking and I almost gave up several times, but through bad times and good, I'm excited this real time strategy game is done!  I hope you enjoy it and if so please let me know, sometimes when things are tough an email or review from a customer really helps.  Game on!


Multiplayer is not supported on iPhone 3GS and iPod Touch 2G & 3G, all other devices are fully supported.

Letter Quiz - alphabet tracing for kids	31845376	USD	1.99	2.4	4+	Games	37	5	1	1	"Letter Quiz is the best way to learn the English Alphabet with over 10,000 copies being purchased by schools. Four different games for every stage of learning; flashcards, identification, matching and handwriting. Designed for kids but great for all ages.

- What People Are Saying:
""I think this Letter Quiz is an awesome app.  I downloaded the free version and my son was begging for the full version. That's when you know its a good one.  So I downloaded the full version and he worked on his letters for an hour.  As a parent, I am so happy that he loves it and he is learning.""

""My 2 year old daughter loves this app. Initially the app had only recognizing the alphabets now it also features writing. My daughter didn't have any interest to write alphabets on paper but when she saw the app, she learned to write in a few days. On the whole excellent app recommend the full version to all parents with little children.""


Four great games to develop your skills:

- ABC Flashcards to get started recognizing letters
The uppercase and lowercase versions of each letter is shown on a card. Tapping on the card flips it over to reveal an object starting with the letter while a voice announces the letter and the objects. Use app settings to play in random order for a change of pace.

- Letter Identification to test knowledge
Multiple letters are shown on the screen and a voice requests you to touch a specific letter. If you touch the right letter, an object is shown starting with that letter, then it moves to the next letter. Get through all 26 letters and you win! Use app settings to play in random order or hide the hints to make the game more difficult.

- Matching uppercase and lowercase letters
The top shows letters in uppercase. The bottom shows letters in lowercase. Draw a line between the two letters matching uppercase and lowercase to get to the next level. Enable random order in app settings for even more challenge.

- Alphabet Tracing to practice handwriting
Each letter is presented full screen with dotted lines shown to guide you through writing the letter. As you trace with your finger, fun sounds play along the line. After each letter is finished they are combined on a blackboard with your full alphabet. You can choose between uppercase and lowercase letters or play in random order by enabling them in the app settings. Complete all 26 letters to unlock the fireworks celebration with exploding letters and music! 

Special Features:
- Universal app plays natively on iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch
- Kid protected section for adjusting settings, no external links without a parent
- Includes both Uppercase and Lowercase letters, enabled in settings
- Localized for US and non US pronunciation for the letter Z (""zed"" vs ""zee"")

物語を彩るキャラクター達
//////////////////////////////////

◇主神オーディン
いわずとしれた神々の長。全ての神々を統率する凄い神…だったのだが、いつの間にかだらけてしまい、最近の口癖は「はたらきたくないでござる」
物忘れがひどく、おっちょこちょいでかなり適当な指示を出す。愛用の「おでんT」は予備も含めて5枚保有。

◇雷神トール
気が優しくて力持ち！オーディンと共に天界で遊ぶことが多くなったが、過去の大戦では特攻隊長を務めた猛者。
思慮が浅く、ほとんどの事は筋肉で解決できると信じている。
力加減が超絶に下手で、神殿のオブジェや貴重なアーティファクトを壊してはフレイヤに叱られる日々を送っている。
娘からプレゼントされた「とおる」と書かれた海パンを愛用している。

◇豊穣の女神フレイヤ
天界きっての常識人。故にオーディンやトールの所業に常にキレながらも的確なツッコミを入れる。
後輩や新人には優しく、新人ヴァルキリーである主人公を優しくサポートしてくれる。

◇神獣スレイプニル
元はオーディンの騎馬として名を馳せた神獣。ひょんなことから人型になってしまったが、インパクトのある見た目とは裏腹に紳士として有名。
人型となっても騎馬としての責務を果たすため、最近はおんぶや肩車、お姫様抱っこでオーディンを目的地へと運んでいる。"	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	17	2317	0	1

Leap of Fate	999398400	USD	3.99	1.0	12+	Games	38	5	1	1	"*** Minimum hardware: iPad 4, iPad mini 2, iPhone 5s. ***

Leap of Fate is a furiously-paced cyberpunk top-down shooter about overcoming your fears and achieving your fate. In a New York City where magic is real, you play as a technomage who must develop unspeakable powers to confront the Crucible of Fates. Can you survive the trials?

Available languages : English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian, and Brazilian Portuguese.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Leap of Fate is a unique blend of isometric perspective, furiously-paced action, and roguelike elements. As one of four technomages hiding in the shadows of New York City, your time has come to confront the Crucible of Fates, a mysterious testing ground that will magically pit you against your own psychological demons. Your journey through the Crucible has you fighting hordes upon hordes of enemies and overcoming deviously laid traps. Your tools are your lightning-fast shadow walk, the powerful glyphs you find, and the magical skills that you upgrade along the way. Your reward for survival? Unspeakable power and a chance to uncover your true fate.

Key Features:
- Experience an extremely fast and satisfying action game, built around the ability to Shadow Walk 
- Upgrade over a hundred magical skills, through an innovative system of randomly-generated skill trees
- Discover the profound and intense stories of four characters, told through beautifully illustrated cinematics
- Explore a modern-day cyberpunk fantasy spanning cybernetics labs, dark alleys and secret societies

The challenge
Combat in Leap of Fate is extremely quick and deadly. Not only will you face more than a hundred different types of enemies, ranging from pit fighters to mad cultists and hidden turrets, but the procedurally generated levels will keep you on your toes at all times. Be warned; once you die, you must restart from the beginning and try again. Hopefully, you'll have unlocked new permanent upgrades to help you along.

Magic
Within each game session, you will find many opportunities to gain magical power. In addition to the game-altering glyphs you randomly find along the way, there are more than a hundred magical abilities total, spread across the Mobility, Attack and Passive skill trees. The twist in Leap of Fate is that skill trees are randomly shuffled, ensuring that each game differs from the previous one. On one run­­, you'll float over pits and disintegrate enemies with Atomic Flash, while in the next, you'll be wielding a projectile-reflecting technology while calling upon the Greys to abduct your foes for you.

Characters
In Leap of Fate, you play one of four mages, each with their own distinct gameplay style and storyline:
- Aeon, the shadow mage: Psychologically scarred by years of oppression in a secret society
- Big Mo, the cyborg technomancer: Wrestling to come to terms with his dual nature
- Mukai, the spirit channeler: Struggling to regain control of her mind from three powerful entities
- Rasimov, the rogue occultist: A centuries-old mage on an endless quest to cheat death

They say this place makes you face your own fears, your own demons. But it can also reveal your fate, if you survive the trials."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	12	3393	0	1

Paul Pixel - The Awakening	107995136	USD	1.99	1.8	9+	Games	37	5	3	1	"An ordinary guy forced to defend the world from an alien invasion of infectious zombies. A point-and-click adventure with beautiful pixel art and bombastic retro sound. 

""It looks great, it controls wonderfully, and it's got a cheeky sense of humor"" - Pocket Gamer: 8/10

Featured in App Store section ""New Games We Love"".

The Gameplay

Gameplay is similar to old games like Maniac Mansion, Zac McKraken, Beneath A Steel Sky and Monkey Island, but the game has a unique interface that is optimized for touch. Unlike most other point-and-click adventures the player actually holds the current item in his hand.


The Graphics

All handcrafted pixel art.


The Music

All game music only uses original Commodore C64 SID chip sounds, but polyphonic and with professional effects. The main theme of the Paul Pixel game was composed by the Pixel Lover Orchestra and is called ""They Want To Get Us"". Other chiptune highlights are ""The Awakening"" by the underground duo Retro Arcade Boys and ""The Giant Meteor"" by 8-Bit Factory.


The Story

An average guy called Paul Pixel discovers that the part of the city where he lives was put in quarantine. Apparently there has been a zombie outbreak. He needs to get out...

Of course, a short time later he needs to save the whole earth from this zombie apocalypse.
